        "description": "How Mining Works For most users of cryptocurrencies it is not necessary to understand how the mining process in itself works, but it is fundamentally important to understand that there is a mining process to create the virtual currency. Unlike currencies as we know them today where governments and banks can simply choose to print unlimited amounts (Not saying they do so, just a point), cryptocurrencies has to be mined by users using a mining program that solves sophisticated algorithms in order to release blocks of coins that can go into circulation. This is part that makes the cryptocurrencies unique, as there is nobody who can simply press a button and get unlimited coins. Everybody can compete equally while mining coins, by buying the same equipment as one another.  The different cryptocurrencies uses different types of algorithms in order for the blocks to be released, but in general it is not something that you should be using your computer to do as it takes specific equipment to mine and it will provide you with a huge electricity bill compared to the profits you will be able to make from it. It is also worth noting that the more coins that has been mined from a cryptocurrency, the more difficult it gets to release new blocks and thus get new coins. The algorithms has been made this way, to ensure that all the coins would not be mined instantly and leave room for the currency to stabilize and not be over populated from the beginning, thus not having any significant value for anyone besides the miners.",

        "description": "Support us with Bitcoin: $15 - Get a Mycelium t-shirt $40 - Get a Mycelium Entropy device $50 - Get a Mycelium Entropy device, and a t-shirt $2000 - Get a Customized Business Pack Mycelium Entropy is a small USB device with a single purpose: Making it easy to create Bitcoin paper wallets in a secure controlled environment. Paper wallets are created in 3 simple steps: Insert Mycelium Entropy into a printer that allows you to print pictures from a USB flash drive. Select the print option on the printer. There is no step 3. This way the paper wallet has never touched a computer or a network, and as soon as you eject the device the private key is wiped from memory. Mycelium Entropy is the easiest and most secure way of creating a paper wallet for offline cold storage. How does it work? When Mycelium Entropy is inserted into a USB socket, it powers up and generates a large random number based on hardware entropy. That number is turned into a Bitcoin private key and a Bitcoin address. The private key and the address are turned into QR codes and and stored in a JPG file, and the USB device presents itself as a USB flash drive. This allows a printer that can print photos off a USB flash drive to print the paper wallet directly off the device. Here is a paper wallet sample: http://i.imgur.com/L36LZgY.jpg The hardware based entropy is collected by using a chip with static RAM as the source of entropy, as described in the scientific paper: Power-up SRAM State as an Identifying Fingerprint and Source of True Random Numbers (Holcomb, D.E.; Burleson, W.P.; Fu, K.). Quote from the article: \" We demonstrate that a 512-bite SRAM fingerprint contains sufficient entropy to generate 128-bit true random numbers, and that the generated numbers pass the NIST tests for runs, approximate entropy, and block-frequency. \" Because Mycelium Entropy collects entropy from tens of thousands of SRAM cells, the result is impossible to guess. Every time you plug the device into a USB port, the power-up process makes the SRAM cells contain a completely random state, allowing the chip to create a different high entropy random number. This allows you to make as many safe and secure paper wallets as you wish. When paired with the Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet, with its ability to spend directly from cold storage paper wallets, storing and using Bitcoin securely becomes very easy for anyone. Here is a video showing Jan, one of our lead developers, demonstrating the prototype: Mycelium Entropy will be 100% open source, and uses off-the-shelf components. It is fully programmable and more features can be added over time. We will make it trivially easy to flash the device using either firmware you download from us, signed with our key, or with your own custom changes to our source code. This is your guarantee that the device does not contain any malware or back doors. Flashing is as easy as plugging it in, turning on flash mode, and copying files over to the drive. You will be able to download the sources, make any changes, build your own and flash the device. From the very start Mycelium Entropy will, in addition to supporting classic paper wallets, also support 2-of-3 split private keys using a technique called Shamir's Secret Sharing. This allows you to split a private key into 3 paper shares, where any two of the three shares are needed to get access to your bitcoins. That way, if one of your shares gets lost or stolen, you can still combine the remaining two shares to get access to your funds. This is far superior to any password encrypted private key scheme. Here is a sample: http://i.imgur.com/CGHWIcS.jpg Going forward we plan to add the option of generating master seeds for BIP32 HD wallets as a downloadable upgrade. Mycelium Entropy will be made in Europe and assembled in Austria (known for its strict privacy laws), and will be shipped in a hologram sealed box to prevent tampering while en-route. Reason for Raising Money Although the device hardware is open source, we need to raise money to be able to order them in sufficient enough quantities to make them cheaper for everyone. Mass production is much cheaper than ordering them one at a time. Also, about $1,500 of the money raised will go towards testing and compliance for these types of devices, like CE marks, FCC part 15 approvals, etc. While the devices are being developed, we will spend time testing printers and putting together a list of recommended printers to use with these, just to make sure that yours can handle this, or if it can't, to help you find the cheapest (and most secure) option you can get. Stretch goals If we raise $30,000, we will add Litecoin support as a downloadable feature. If we raise $40,000, we will add the second more popular blockchain-based cryptocurrency by market cap, which at present is PeerCoin If we raise$60,000, wow. such money. very rich. have dogecoin. If we somehow miraculously manage to raise $120,000, we will forgo all sleep for the next two month, and get HD out by the time we ship these. Risks and challenges The device designs are finished, and the prototypes are fully functional. We also have manufacturers lined up, ready to assemble the units for us. We just need the funding to start the initial run of production. The only problems we may run into are related to the manufacturers, such as unforeseen production delays, though we believe they will be unlikely.

Folding@home (FAH) is developed by Stanford University and has been running for almost 15 years. What \u00a0FAH does is has anyone in the world download a \"protein simulation\" program onto their PCs to simulate how proteins fold and unfold in the human body.\u00a0The results of all this distributed computation is <a href=\"http://folding.stanford.edu/home/papers/\">tabulated and analyzed</a> to help new find new medicines and cures to some of the worst diseases faced by man such as Cancer. Anyone can donate their PC computational cycles as FAH is a 501(c)3 non profit and <a href=\"https://folding.stanford.edu/home/faq/faq-opensource/#ntoc2\">all the results are available</a> to medical and scientific researchers upon request. This is a great way to help fight cancer without having to give time or money. The program runs in the background of your computer when you are not using it.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>But there's a problem. There's no reward for sharing your computer cycles in this way. You can\u00a0<a href=\"http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=userstats\">join a team and you can earn points</a>, but there is no profit motive to help with research.</p><p>FoldingCoin Inc. was created to drive more participation to FAH by distributing the crypto currency FLDC (like <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/\">Bitcoin</a>) to participants of Folding@home. <a href=\"https://www.poloniex.com/exchange#btc_fldc\">FLDC can be exchanged for BTC</a> and <a href=\"https://exchange.coinbase.com/\">BTC can be exchanged for US dollars</a> thus giving a profit motive to fold. FoldingCoin Inc.</p><h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>To explain in depth what Bitcoin is would take a long time on this campaign. Please watch the provided video for an excellent brief description of what Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency is.\n\n<h2>What does Bitcoin have to do with medicine creation on FAH?</h2><p> </p><p>Thats simple, Bitcoin allows profit for running your computational cycles and FAH does not. Please watch this video for complete details on how this will work but I will put the main points here in the campaign page.</p><p></p><p>Lets take a look at the computational power of the three single biggest computational networks in the world:</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.top500.org/\">The Worlds fastest SuperComputer = 33 PetaFLOPS</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://folding.stanford.edu/home/about-us/\">The FAH project = 48 PetaFLOPS</a>\u00a0\n</li>\n<li>\n<b><a href=\"http://www.bitcoinwatch.com/\">The Bitcoin Network = 4,064,260 PetaFLOPS</a></b>\n</li>\n</ul><p>Since there is a profit motive for people to contribute power to the Bitcoin network it has become\u00a0123,159 times more powerful than the worlds fastest supercomputer. The way Bitcoin became so powerful is because specialized hardware was created for Bitcoin mining called ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). Before the ASICs though there was enough computational power in general PCs to equal\u00a0330 PetaFLOPS.</p><p></p><p>Imagine if that power was harnessed for molecular protein folding. Most of this power was redirected to altcoin mining after the ASICs came out since that was the next profitable thing, and power was not redirected towards FAH since there was no profit motive for folding. FoldingCoin Inc. looks to bring a profit motive for people to fold proteins by distributing FLDC along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRL1ewGw6AY\">other Counterparty tokens</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Venture capitalists could see this as an opportunity to invest in the creation of economic sized Anton Supercomputer, which is an ASIC molecular protein simulating machine that can fold more efficiently than standard computing hardware. This very thing happened to Bitcoin mining when it became exponentially profitable: venture capitalists invested in the creation of ASIC miners to compute Bitcoin at a more efficient rate than standard computing hardware.</p><h2>So where is your money going to?</h2><p></p><p>On January 5th 2015 I decided to go full time with developing FoldingCoin Inc. We have a great <a href=\"http://foldingcoin.net/fldc-dev-team/\">team of developers</a> \u00a0that work on FoldingCoin Inc. on a purely volunteer basis. All of the FLDC devs still have full time jobs for income, but I no longer do.\u00a0</p><p>FoldingCoin Inc. has become popular enough where its success depends on one of us going full time developing it and I have decided to take that route. In the crypto currency world having a very active dev that responds to emails and forums quickly can be a crucial key. The money you donate will support my ability to continue developing FoldingCoin Inc. full time without having to get a job to pay my rent. I work 60-70 hours a week on FoldingCoin Inc. and\u00a0I only need $10,000 dollars to work for 1 calendar year as my bills are split between 3 people and I have no children to tend to. This will equal to a little over $3 an hour for me all year. Its not much, but I can live very cheap :D\u00a0</p><p>Any excess of the $10,000 dollars will go directly to fund FoldingCoin Inc. I do wish to note that FoldingCoin Inc. will be running a crowd funding campaign later in the year with some great new innovations we wish to develop that will be very expensive. This campaign you are looking to fund is to ensure I can keep my focus on the missions of FoldingCoin Inc. so we can reach that point of doing a large crowd funding sale for FoldingCoin Inc.\u00a0</p><p>Another way I wish to bring in income is by <a href=\"http://rros42.wix.com/acceptbtc\">helping Indianapolis businesses start accepting Bitcoin</a> as a payment method and FLDC as a discount token for products and/or services from those businesses. I am only charging $100 for the service and this includes full training of the establishments staff on Bitcoin and how it works.</p><p>Projects like Bitcoin and FoldingCoin are fantastic ways to help improve our world and actually make charitable work profitable. If you do not wish to donate to this cause at this time I encourage you to help create medicines on your computer. It is a very easy two step setup to get started:</p><p></p><ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://foldingcoin.net/counterparty-guides/#wallet\">Step 1. Get a FLDC wallet</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://foldingcoin.net/windows-guides/#setup\">Step 2. Setup your Folding client</a>\n</li>\n</ul>Most of the perks that I offer in this campaign require you to get a Counterwallet address. Please go to <a href=\"http://foldingcoin.net/counterparty-guides/#wallet\">THIS LINK</a> to setup your Counterparty wallet and email me your Bitcoin address found in the tutorial, setting up a wallet is free. If I reach my goal then any unclaimed perks of me setting up a business with Bitcoin acceptance will be donated to a local charity in Indianapolis and I will get them started with Bitcoin instead.Thank you and if you have further questions please do not hesitate to contact me via email rross@foldingcoin.net :)FoldingCoin Inc. was built to support Stanford's Folding@home but no direct partnership is established. FoldingCoin Inc. is independant from Stanford.<p></p>",

        "description": "<div>\n<p>For the past 2.5 years, I have been writing extensively about Bitcoin, Blockchains, Cryptocurrency and Decentralization, because I'm very passionate about these topics. </p><p>I was very lucky to have been directly involved\u00a0along side other pioneers, technology leaders, entrepreneurs, startups, enterprise executives and practioners who are at the leading edges of this new technological revolution.\u00a0</p><p>This allowed me to produce a good amount of original thoughts\u00a0that have been highly appreciated by a large audience, because it was helping them see the possibilities ahead. My work has been referenced in over 100 other publications or write-ups, a testimony to the quality of my thought leadership.\u00a0</p><p>I have given numerous presentations on the blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, cyptocurrencies and decentralization.</p><div>\n\n\nThis is me, speaking about the blockchain!\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>But many of my colleagues and friends kept asking me to write more, specifically a book.\u00a0</p><p>So, I decided to put everything I know, and more new research into 2 books, starting with what I'm calling \"<b>The Business Blockchain Series</b>\".\u00a0</p><p>Let me explain the blockchain, briefly.</p><p>If a new technological invention arrived and commanded an impact as profound as the Internet, every person would rush to pay attention, and ask: what do I need to know to understand it, and what are the implications I need to be prepared for?</p><p>The Blockchain technological revolution is that new invention, but it will enter the realm of business realization, only when everyone understands it and what it means for them. </p><p><b>So, what is the Blockchain?</b> The Blockchain is a set of networked and cryptography-based technology infrastructure and programmable capabilities that facilitate a new category of trust-based services. These services can be created or exchanged without central intermediaries, affecting the flow of value and its lifecycle across assets, money, ownership, identity, rights, contracts, governance and regulation. Basically, the blockchain touches everything in society, business, and government.</p><p>In addition to the 50 blog posts I have already written on this topic, just in the past 12 months, here is a reading sample of some of the most significant pieces I have authored:</p><ul>\n<li>\nWhy the Blockchain is the New Website\u00a0<i>(Forbes)</i>\n</li>\n<li>\nBlockchain 2015: Strategic Analysis in Financial Services (173,000 views on Slideshare)\n</li>\n<li>\nThe Business Imperative Behind the Ethereum Vision\u00a0<i>(Ethereum Blog)</i>\n</li>\n<li>\nHow the Cryptoconomy Will be Created\u00a0<i>(Forbes)</i>\n</li>\n<li>\nAfter The Social Web, Here Comes The Trust Web\u00a0<i>(TechCrunch)</i>\n</li>\n<li>\nUnderstanding the Blockchain (O\u2019Reilly)</li>\n</ul><p>I've already enjoyed great support via my blog readership that has skyrocketed in the past few months, but what's even more important to me is to connect with you, as someone interested in the blockchain's impact on our future, whether you wish to learn about it, or whether you are applying this technology in your domains of expertise.\u00a0</p><p><b>The Business Blockchain</b> will be the first in-depth business book on the blockchain, written by someone who has been as involved as I have in this space, and with the breadth of knowledge and experience in the technology sector.</p><p>The second book, <b>Centerless</b>, will depict how Decentralization is compelling us to rethink trust, wealth and information. We will be impacted by an increased pace of decentralization, one way or the other.</p><p>Your support will enable me to self-publish these 2 books with the highest possible quality, while proving that the power of crowd funding and fan level support can trump traditional publishers and old-school distribution methods. And you will be the first recipients of this valuable work. <i><b>The first book will NOT be available to the general public until April, and you will receive the second book 2 weeks prior to anyone getting it from Amazon.</b></i></p><p>Self-publishing these 2 books is important because it avoids the excessive delays of traditional publishers who require authors to freeze their manuscripts 6-9 months prior to publication. In the dog-years world of Bitcoin and the blockchain, this means that the published work may be already outdated, whereas a self-published book can be out in the market only 3-5 weeks after the last word is written. And that's my plan.</p><p>To professionally produce a single e-book, including book cover design, inside layout, copy editing, proofing, distribution and marketing, but not including printing and shipping,\u00a0costs about $US 7,000.</p><p>All backers at the $US 48 level and higher will be invited to a private Slack channel, to follow progress on the 2nd book and collaborate, via opt-in. Slack members will receive some early content access.</p><p>Finally, I will also share drafts and excerpts of the work in progress on Wattpad, which is a powerful platform where readers and writers meet. I believe Wattpad is a solid community for receiving further feedback, and interacting with another segment of readers.</p><p>Here are the details about what will be inside these books:</p><p><b>The Business Blockchain: A Primer on the Promise, Practice and Application of the Next Internet Technology</b></p><div>\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> \nThe fundamental characteristics of blockchains are puzzling to consumers, corporations, governments, policy makers and regulators, because their implementation challenges centrally orchestrated trust, and enables a new kind of trust: one that is distributed, decentralized, from peer to peer, and not centrally managed by any single entity. Take any service, and add \u201cwithout previous center-based authority\u201d, and replace by \u201cpeer to peer, trust-based network\u201d, and you will start to imagine the possibilities.</p><p>My goal for this book is to describe a future that is influenced by fundamental shifts brought upon by blockchain technology as the catalyst for change. However, that picture is only useful if you are convinced to be part of that change, and if you understand that the blockchain\u2019s foray is inevitable.</p><p>We also need to be clear about the new roles and benefits of the blockchain, in a differentiated and augmented manner, and not merely seeing it as a replacement to something that already exists.</p><p>This book will represent a substantial blueprint for understanding how to frame the blockchain and how to uncover its related opportunities for change. It will be a call to action covering: </p><ul>\n<li>What is the Blockchain?\u00a0</li>\n<li>Obstacles and Challenges\u00a0</li>\n<li>Opportunities and Possibilities\u00a0</li>\n<li>Blockchain Touch Points\u00a0</li>\n<li>Consumer Scenarios\u00a0</li>\n<li>Business Applications\u00a0</li>\n<li>Implementing the Blockchain\u00a0</li>\n<li>Seeing the Future\u00a0</li>\n</ul><p><b>Centerless: Rethinking Trust, Wealth and Information in the Age of Decentralization</b></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> \nFollowing <b>The Business Blockchain</b>, this second book will take you beyond the blockchain and into the world of decentralization, a powerful concept that redefines the role of the center by shifting power and control away from its previous constructs. With decentralization, centers will control less, but they will facilitate more.</p><p>Bitcoin and blockchain technology are necessary but not obligatory catalysts for this decentralization, because they are the enabling networks, technology infrastructure and facilitators of trust-based decentralized services.</p><p>We must not just ask what visible problems decentralization solves, rather we should let it create new opportunities, solutions and possibilities beyond what we see.\u00a0The status quo doesn\u2019t like to be disturbed, but it needs to be shaken in order to yield new results.\u00a0</p><p>This second book will go beyond helping you to understand the relationship between decentralization and our future. It will save you time trying to figure it out, and you will be able to discover new opportunities and benefit from them.</p><p>Key Themes in the book: </p><p><b>Part I Decentralization Theory </b></p><p>Decentralization is going to influence every corner of our world. To understand it, I will break down its various components to help you identify where change will be required.</p><p><b>Part II Trilogy of Decentralization Impact</b></p><p><i><b>Trust:</b></i> Law, Governance, Services (e.g. Financial, Government, Trade, Healthcare)</p><p><i><b>Wealth:</b></i> Economic production, Flow of value, Transactions </p><p><i><b>Information:</b></i> Content, Privacy, Security</p><p><b>Part III Practical Implementations </b></p><p><b>Peer-to-Peer:</b> The Edges of the Network Light Up <b>Trust-based Systems and Services:</b> Powerful, but Centerless <b>The New Flow of Value:</b> A New Supply Chain is Born\n<b>Decentralizing Everything:</b> There is a New Something for Everything<b>Autonomous Organizations:</b> Putting Fiction into Reality\u00a0<b>Wealth Creation in the Cryptoconomy:</b> Booting up a New, Sustainable Economy</p><p>If you\u2019re at the center, you may live in a dilemma of restrictions, but you need to challenge yourself to figure out how to disrupt some of your central pieces and align them to the new flow of decentralization.</p><p>Decentralization is already here, but it hasn't been evenly distributed. Let\u2019s be prepared.</p>\n</div>",

So, what are doing? We are giving a <i>physical\u00a0face</i> to a <i>virtual product</i>\u00a0- and by doing that we are bridging <i>the</i> gap the digital currency economy has been bottlenecked by. \u00a0Merchants are accepting bitcoin faster than customers are spending it - but that is about to change!</p>\n<p><i>* \u00a0 \u00a0 * \u00a0 \u00a0 *</i></p>\n<p>Imagine this:</p>\n<p>You walk in to your local convenience store, grab a drink and head to the register. \u00a0In your peripheral vision you catch a glance of a card on the counter, that says <i>BuyAnyCoin Voucher</i>. You ask the cashier about the card - she tells you, \"You just redeem it at their website for any of the popular digital currencies like bitcoin\".</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n\n</p><p><i>Oh, sweet, </i>you think to yourself. \u00a0<i>This is awesome; I figured out how to get bitcoins a few months ago, but what a hassle! \u00a0This seems way easier - just grab the card and go.</i></p>\n<p><i>* \u00a0 \u00a0 * \u00a0 \u00a0 *</i></p>\n<p>Yes - 'figuring out' how to <i>get</i> bitcoin (or any other digital currency) has been one of the biggest hurdles to get over for someone curious about the technology. \u00a0Even die-hard geeks that understand how amazing it is to be able to manage your finances with futuristic tools and applications have had difficulty cobbling together a good plan to get started. \u00a0But these are just temporary problems; the internet made this technology possible, and now it is going to make it <i>REAL</i>.</p>\n<p>There's no reason you shouldn't have the power and speed of digital currency at your fingertips while stopping at the gas station to buy a beverage. \u00a0 With BuyAnyCoin's marketing strategy, the average individual is finally given direct <i>physical access</i> to a <i>virtual product</i>. This is the best gateway to adoption, giving the customer something they already know and connecting it to something they want to use; digital currency!</p>\n<p>Digital currency is moving from the high-tech space to public relevance, and BuyAnyCoin is here to accelerate that transition by both understanding and appealing to <i>real people. \u00a0</i>Instead of asking them to change their habits to try something new, we're aligning with their existing habits and legitimizing the next generation of financial technology - literally\u00a0<i>before their very eyes.</i></p>\n<p>Our company is not a bet on the success of Bitcoin alone, but rather an investment in the millions of people and billions of man-hours already spent building this unprecedented new industry which <i>already </i>blows the competition away. \u00a0Digital financial tech is ready to be put in the hands of the everyday consumer!</p>\n<p>  </p><div> <h3>Your Dollars Making Sense</h3>\n</div>\n<div>BuyAnyCoin is looking for $10,000 to engage our online retail market and finish development for our merchant partnerships. The money will also provide initial operating capital and enable a first-round production of our gift cards.</div>\n<b><i>Development</i> </b>- We have a fast, stable, sleek web application that serves as the hub for our selected cryptos and assets (BAC Web App). What we need to develop is a merchant-accessible back end that will allow new merchants to sign up, receive cards and be able to settle balances on accounts with us. To ensure we can stretch our dollars the furthest we contract with a friend and developer in India who provides a great price-to skill-ratio.</i></i><div><i><i>\n<p>\n\n</p></i></i><div><i><i>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<b><i>Operating Capital</i>\u00a0</b>- Every business needs operating capital; we are not unique in this charge. To be able to provide near-instant access to all of the digital currencies we provide, we will need to have a stock of them. This ultimately will require a small but liquid amount of money that can freely move in and out of digital currencies.\n</div>\n</i></i><div><i><i>\n<div>\n<div><i><b></b></i></div><b>\n<div>\n<i><b>Gift Card Production</b></i> - Our very first gift card run will be through a 3rd-party card manufacture costing us about $600-$800 for the first 1,000 cards. After we get our first cards and merchant partners, we'll acquire a printer to manufacture the cards in-house. The card printer we priced is $1,800 which will give us a better ROI per card in the long run than the 3rd-party solution.</div>\n<div>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\n</p></div>\n<div>\n<b>PERKS PERKS PERKS!</b>\n</div>\n<div>If anyone has ever heard of Coinbase, they might remember that when they first got funded, they had over 20,000 applicants apply for positions. Well, a few of our perks are going to provide you direct insider access to BuyAnyCoin. We want you to get involved, see us grow and potentially become a valued member of BuyAnyCoin! What better reward is there than to donate to a growing company and be able to be a part of that growth from then on?</div>\n<div>**We would love to give people some of our first round production gift cards but with regulatory concerns with money law restrictions we cannot do this, sorry!**</div>  <div> <h3>The Impact; The Social Significance</h3> <p>No fraud, no chargebacks, money anywhere in the world within seconds, unprecedented security of your money. The impact of widespread adoption of digital currencies is enormous. If merchants can save thousands and pass those saving to you by 10-20% off goods because they don't need a fraud department, why are you not using digital currency? \u00a0If you can send money to your best friend without massive fees, why are you not using digital currencies?</p>\n<p>The answer is simple, BuyAnyCoin hasn't launched yet! \u00a0Right now, the hardest part about using digital currencies is acquiring them in the first place. \u00a0We're going to make this as easy as buying a bag of Doritos!</p>\n<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Everest In The Eyes Of BuyAnyCoin (aka challenges)</h3> <p>Our biggest challenge is going to be education of customers. \u00a0We are watching the adoption rate of bitcoin and other digital currencies rise around the world, but it will happen a lot faster when we successfully educate our customers.</p>\n<p>This is why, as you can see in our introductory video, we promote the three primary benefits of digital currencies (Security, Logistics, and Irreversibility), and do <i>NOT</i> focus on price. \u00a0We will be putting out a blog post with an in-depth explanation of these primary benefits soon!</p>\n<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Wanna Help But Lack The Dough? No Problem...</h3> <p>We understand that not everyone can contribute financially to the company but that does not mean you cannot be involved and help!</p>\n<p>We have tons of ideas that need to happen and we need people just like you, people that want to help make positive change.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is a list of awesome projects and tasks we need help with regardless of money!</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>\nSocial Media sharing: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FACEBOOK\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0TWITTER\n</li>\n<li>Tell your friends and family about BuyAnyCoin!</li>\n<li>Make a BuyAnyCoin account and provide feedback on features and usability!</li>\n<li>Blog posts and PR - organic traffic is priceless!</li>\n<li>Media kit designs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If BuyAnyCoin inspires you to contribute your time and effort towards our vision of financial evolution, definitely get in touch with us at team@buyanycoin.com!</p>\n<p>The volunteers we need (but are not limited to)</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Social Media Manager\u00a0</li>\n<li>US based Javascript/Meteor Developer</li>\n<li>Customer Service and Support</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<h3>Prefer To Donate Your Favorite Crypto? (Awesome!)</h3>\nSee updates page for contribution addresses!\n</div>\n<p>\n</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<h3><b>FAQ</b></h3>\n<p><i>Why we started the Company\u00a0</i>- We all recognized a vital missing link in the digital currency ecosystem and asked ourselves, if not us, who will make this a reality?</p>\n<p><i>What problems do we solve</i>\u00a0- We are connecting to people with something they're already doing (this model is already being used to process billions of dollars with gift cards for products like iTunes and Facebook). \u00a0We are solving digital currency's biggest hindrance; getting it into the hands of the people in a way they are already comfortable with. We are the central hub and access point for digital currencies.</p>\n<p><i>Why we will be successful\u00a0</i>- We know the market, we know what people want and we can deliver. Additionally, we have a pipeline of updates that will continue to empower our customers and only serve to strengthen our position. Our level of planning goes beyond a single year; we are thinking many years in the future and positioning ourselves to capitalize on the market when it catches up with our planning.</p>Thanks for your time! \u00a0We can't wait to start working with some of the ideas YOU bring to the table!</div>\n</b></div><b>\n</b></i></i></div></div></div></i></b></b></h3></div>",

It has lost its ability to be a true peoples currency as its flow is controlled by corporations with large mining farms that individuals cannot compete with.<b>Bitcoin for all intents and purposes is now the same as CASH as it requires a BANK like structure of regulation and corporate influences to function.</b>Rimbit is and always be, you and the person you trade with, which makes it a fully fledged peoples currency without all the restrictions of corporations and policy makers.Rimbit is the next generation in Digital Currency, allowing you to get involved while the project is in its early stages.<p><b>When you contribute and purchase a Perk, you help us continue to develop the Rimbit software/hardware ecosystem that will propel Rimbit as the Crypto Currency of choice in the years to come!</b></p><p>Rimbit has changed the playing field and anyone with just $2 can contribute to Rimbit and use our wallets easily and quickly and that is why Rimbit is quickly moving up the ranks as a valuable tool in the Crypto Currency industry!</p><strong>Our support forum is at <a href=\"http://rimbitforum.com/\">www.rimbitforum.com</a></strong><p>\n  Our forum is full of fantastic Rimbit users and has many tips and ideas for people wanting to get into Rimbit! We listen to what the community wants and we develop tools to meet those demands.</p>\n<p><strong>We have now setup Team Rimbit on Steam</strong>\n  Rimbit is connecting with as many industries as possible and one of them is the Game Industry, which has a turnover that is larger then the Music or Movie Industry and as Rimbit involves itself with that market, we hope that Game developers, including Indiegames, take notice, watch our progress and involve Rimbit technology into their system. \n  <i><b>Click the Steam Logo below to view and join our TEAM!\n  </b></i>\n<a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rimbit\"></a></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Rimbit is a Digital Currency, much like Bitcoin, in fact, we used much of Bitcoin core code, along with code from other coins to come up with a unique Crypto Currency that makes it more stable and less susceptible to wild fluctuations.</p><p>A typical Rimbit Address looks like this- <b>RGqzTy314psaQ59nmoFREYpeJ6xzwjDs2W</b>\n</p>\n<p></p>This is the easy part that shows how easy Rimbit is to use. Apart from the wallet, there is nothing else anyone needs to use as the wallet will do all sending and receiving as well as all the verifying and confirmation of transactions. Yes, we have made it very simple for everyone!<ol>\n  <li><strong>Download a wallet from our Main Website <a href=\"http://rimbit.com/wallets/wallets-version-1-1-0\">http://rimbit.com/wallets/wallets-version-1-1-0</a></strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Purchase a Perk at Indiegogo</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>We have a fantastic forum of users just like you that can help you with problems. <a href=\"http://rimbitforum.com/\">http://rimbitforum.com/</a></strong></li>\n  <li><strong>We also have an Android Wallet that you can find using Google Playstore <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rimbit.android_wallet\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rimbit.android_wallet</a></strong></li>\n</ol><p></p><p></p><p>When you make a contribution to Rimbit, you are contributing to the continued development of new software, updated software and even hardware, for the use of Rimbit and in return, we will send you some Rimbit to use on the network, using the Software that your contributions have allowed us to accomplish.As time goes on, we will investigate and possibly develop certain hardware that can be used to \"plug\" into the Rimbit network and all this is possible from contributions that have allowed us the financial resources to expand development in many new and creative ways!<strong>Our goals for Rimbit over the next few years are:</strong>\n</p><ul>\n  <li>Continue to improve the Rimbit Wallets</li>\n  <li>Add new features to Rimbit Wallets</li>\n  <li>Improve the Rimbit Infrastructure</li>\n  <li>Setup a governing body for Rimbit</li>\n  <li>Continue funding individual Rimbit Projects</li>\n  \n  <li>Achieve full distribution of the 300 Million Rimbit</li>\n  <li>Disburse more Rimbit to schools (We already have one school using Rimbit to teach its pupils about Crypto Currency)</li>\n  <li>Continue charitable distribution of Rimbit to selected groups and organizations</li>\n</ul><ul>\n</ul>\n<h3>We are just Developers</h3>\n<p>We are only developers and it is the community that own Rimbit. Every user is part of a peer network that helps each other verify transactions, all being done via the Rimbit wallet and is not subject to companies centralizing the coin, by controlling its distribution. </p><p>Rimbit, once its out, cannot be stopped and that is why it has an <b>unlimited lifespan</b>!</p>\n<h3>Rimbit is for You and for Merchants</h3>\n<p>Creating Rimbit started out after I had to close the option to sell my products with Bitcoin. As Bitcoin fluctuated so much, I was always at a loss as I didn't have time to constantly check the stock market and make risky decisions when to sell my Bitcoin. After all, I am a merchant, not a stock broker.</p><p></p><p></p>\n<p>So I looked at the system and discovered that Bitcoin is a rushed mess of circumstances that have not been looked at properly and when discussing it with Bitcoin developers, it soon became apparent that they all know the problems, but choose to ignore some very major issues.</p>\n<p>I then looked at every problem Bitcoin has and tested many ways to overcome them. The major problem Bitcoin has is mining, which the technology will soon have trouble keeping up, effectively slowing down Bitcoin and making it worthless in the years to come. So we removed the mining aspect and we discovered that Rimbit could be much more stable as its not reliant on many of the factors that are needed for other coins to continue evolving.</p>\n<p>We found a way that everyone can use Rimbit, with just a simple desktop machine or Mobile Device and to verify each others transactions and this is where we had the \"EUREKA\" moment. Its at this point we knew we had to develop Rimbit and get it out to the public, before the inevitable problems with Bitcoin reared its head... It enables Bitcoin users to (when the time comes), jump the sinking ship and jump on board Rimbit which will last them forever, without any of the problems Bitcoin has. </p>\n<h3>Our Community</h3>\n<p>When you start using Rimbit, you will be part of a special community of users who are polite and care for each other and help solve problems, come up with new ideas and even build software to further enhance Rimbit. This community can be found at <a href=\"http://rimbitforum.com/\">http://rimbitforum.com/</a></p>\n",

All purchases made there will result in us manually contributing towards our goal here while the campaign is running. When the campaign ends, we will accept paypal and cryptocurrencies on the external site . What is Invizbox? Invizbox is a small, low power device that helps provide an easy-to-use method of protecting your privacy on the Internet.  You plug Invizbox into your existing router/modem. It creates a new wifi hotspot and you connect any of your devices (laptop, phone, pc, etc) to this hotspot. Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use & competitive price point for this device by drawing together off the shelf hardware and customised open source software solutions. Why do you need Invizbox? We all have a right to privacy, a right to protect our personal information, data, location and internet behavior.  You may think you have nothing to \u201chide\u201d, or you aren\u2019t doing anything \u201cwrong\u201d that would require investigation by third parties but neither do we. That doesn\u2019t mean that we have to leave ourselves open to tracking and profiling by people, governments, companies, hackers etc. who we neither know or trust. Invizbox provides an easy solution to give you back control over who & what you choose to disclose your personal information to. Most people don\u2019t know how to go about protecting their information on the Internet and with Invizbox you don\u2019t need any technical know-how to gain that protection. Where are we right now? Referral Rewards Program Who are we? What we need to get off the ground So, What's the hardware? And the software? I'm worried after being burned by a similar project How are you achieving your low price compared to other products? Purchasing and shipping Where are we right now? We have already established a manufacturing and logistics supply chain to cope with demand. We have added Tor to the OpenWRT software on Invizbox and have also routed traffic through the Tor network. We're currently locking everything down and making sure the firewall rules are solid and there's nothing unnecessary running on the box. We will then move on to developing and enhancing the consumer ready, plug and play experience. Our goal here will be to make this effortless to you the end user and let you get on with normal browsing with significantly enhanced privacy. We have engineering samples in our hands and are amazed at just how small they are. They're tiny! Referral Rewards Program Invizbox for FREE? That's right you read that correctly. We want to reward our backers with either cash (paid through paypal) and / or free Invizboxes. How it works is really easy: Share your unique Indiegogo referral URL anywhere and everywhere (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn etc.) and let people know about Invizbox, how great it is and why your friends should buy one. For every $200 that gets pledged with your unique URL, we will give you $10 (that's only 5 unit pledges). If you reach the lofty heights of $1000 of referrals you will get an Invizbox for FREE and $30 via paypal. You get paid for doing what friends do best: being social! it could not get better than that. Find out more about how to share your referral URL and get more referral information here . Who are we? A 3 person team of computer science professionals with  wide and varied backgrounds which include software development, mobile internet security, lots of Linux experience and security specific qualifications. What we need to get off the ground: Because of our lower profit margins we hope to do a minimum run of 500 units and require 20,000 dollars for this. So, What's the hardware? WT 3020A device Dimensions: 65mm X 45mm X 22mm Supports Wifi b/g/n MAC address filtering Support for WPA / WPA2, WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSK. Support System: Windows / Mac / Linux Colours - White. Power via micro USB (cable included). 16MB flash 64MB RAM (note that we investigating using a slightly faster device, but you should assume that it's the one listed above for now) And the software? The router will run on a locked down version of OpenWRT with Tor. OpenWrt is an open source operating system / embedded operating system based on the Linux kernel, and primarily used on devices like this one. From the Tor project website: Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location. Our part in this is to properly lock down OpenWRT, add the latest version of Tor, add various routing configurations, add a user interface that allows people to set up various Tor config files automatically and in a user friendly way (e.g. for relays if people decide they would like to contribute to the Tor network). We will then QA this and hand it over to the manufacturer as an image for the router. We will be fundamentally altering the way the device would have normally worked. I'm worried after being burned by a similar project: Two of the project founders have security specific qualifications and all of us have many years of software industry experience and extensive Linux knowledge. We will provide documentation clearly outlining what the box is good for and especially what it's not good for . Do not trust your freedom or your life to this technology! It's not designed for that. The OpenWRT image will be properly locked down. No unnecessary daemons will be running on the box. To cover the possibility of intercepted units with rootkits, we will offer the ability to download and flash firmware directly from our site (with hash for verification). We're looking into tamper evident packaging but can't guarantee it. On the issue of hardware back doors: We're not manufacturing directly. We have been assured that there are no back doors and we will test for them, but as before you should not trust your life to this box and we will provide clear documentation covering that (and guidelines on what to consider if you need that actual anonymity). We can't stop browser fingerprinting. We are considering options to help here but for now we'll inform people on ways to avoid it if it's a concern. We're open to suggestion (see link below in the last bullet). If there are vulnerabilities found in Tor, we will patch our firmware and release an update. We have guaranteed logistics and hardware manufacturing capabilities for (within reason) any scale, but priority goes to the first 500 customers. Want to make your own with our firmware? No problem. We'll release full specs on the hardware so you can buy it. If you have questions, there's a thread over here on boards.ie. How are you achieving your low price compared to other products? Low profit margins. Purchasing and shipping: Where do you ship to? Anywhere. Shipping is included in the purchase price. (NOTE: Purchasers are responsible for any VAT or customs duties levied by their own countries).

        "description": "Short Summary Utter.io is an Open Source software platform which uses cryptocurrency technologies to allow users to buy and provision virtual servers.  The platform also enables OpenStack operators to form compute cooperatives using a virtual appliance , allowing fast scaling and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities. This concept may be one possible solution to the challenges associated with achieving a globally federated cloud . Virtual servers for sale are advertised by the appliances on a compute pool . Purchases are done by sending Bitcoin to an address that corresponds to the size and type of instance needed by the user. The screenshot below shows a BItcoin payment address corresponding to an instance ready to be started by an Utter.io virtual appliance running on an account on HPCloud 's Las Vegas datacenter. The StackMonkey pool is the first of many cooperatives, and is intended to be the Wild West of compute pools. The pool is built for use by hackers, crackers, security researchers, developers, do-it-yourselfers, and the communities and technologies developed from their use of the system. Users wishing to launch decentralized software services such as DarkMail , OpenBazaar , Freenet , Tor , MaidSafe , Ethereum and more can start instances with pseudonymity on the coop's deployments, or smaller privately run cloud deployments. No accounts are needed to launch instances ! All code providing basic infrastructure services to the project will be Open Source and will be licensed under the MIT License . Learn More About the Vision If you are interested in learning more about the Utter.io vision, check out the longer-winded video below. I go through the history and future of the cloud, talk about the trust the blockchain brings us and how a computed trust based cloud gives us a path to a globally federated cloud anyone can use by simply clicking and paying. The distributed cloud paper I refer to in the video can be found here . Now you know why I had to build my own teleprompter for the 3 minute version: I talk a lot. Also, be sure to read Code of Trust , a blog post I wrote last year. It explains why our trust in cloud technologies remains a challenge for infrastructure architecture today. If you are interested in seeing the technology in action, check out the video my daughter Lily and I did doing a demo of Utter.io's features on StackMonkey. If we are successfully funded, a non-profit foundation will be established to manage the project and help establish a user-centric community for raising awareness and continued project development. Development Timeline The project is currently in beta, hosted on hosted on Github and is 100% Open Source. An instance of the pool controller is currently running at StackMonkey , and is hosted on Google AppEngine. The beta launched in October. The appliance is generally available for use by following simple instructions to install from Github. Users can set prices for the compute they wish to sell by configuring their local copy of the appliance. The image below demonstrates the setup of the appliance. Development over the next two quarters will focus on the decentralization of key services inside the framework, including: alternative platforms for hosting advertisement pools a flexible and reliable blockchain payment monitoring tool payment instances to manage auto-payments for deployments server/service authentication via bitcoin keys using bitauth / bitid decentralized SSL tunnel hosted on appliances for instance access numerous features related to security and reliability Support will also continue to be provided via community driven content, email support and contract work for entities wishing to deploy federated compute on their infrastructures.  New feature requests will be considered for special deployments. With funding, Utter.io sets a goal of adding over 100 providers in 30 countries to the StackMonkey pool next year. Rewards Physical rewards like stickers and t-shirts will be shipped using economy class shipping. We'll need to collect things like shipping address and shirt sizes from you. Account rewards like priority support and early access features will be done via a tokenized page on the website.  Please note that verifying your identity will be required when you collect the rewards!  If you are privacy sensitive, you may wish to simply contribute a custom amount to the project at the lowest reward level. The developer off-site is intended for developers only.  Ideally you are skilled in a wide array of infrastructure technologies and can contribute through architecture and/or coding.  If you'd like to purchase the development offsite for someone who might be interested, but can't afford it, we're more than happy to make arrangements for them. Post Funding If we are funded, StackMonkey and the Utter.io framework will have their IP assigned to a non-profit foundation to encourage continued innovation in development and expansion of network services. The minimum viable funding for the project has been determined to be US$49,000. This amount will allow for the two existing full time developers to continue working on the project for the next six months. If funding is over-goal, or we manage to raise more funding in another manner, I will use the amount to help forecast a budget for the foundation to use to hire additional developers.  Ideally we'd like a team of 6-7 people working on this full time, with a minimum of a year's burn available.  That puts the funds needed for payroll at about US$1M, given they were located in the Bay (assuming they worked on a discount, sadly enough). Given we're looking for efficiencies, we have decided it would be good idea to decentralize the team. This lowers living costs, allows for a wider range of skill choices, and provides a good life/work balance for the developers. We're planning on doing a foundation offsite every 4 months or so to ensure good execution on planning and helping build relationships. Opportunities are likely to exist in the future for raising venture capital for offerings based on top of the framework. After the foundation is well established, other developers and I may choose to become a part of efforts to produce commercial opportunities from the platform/network. There may also be an opportunity to do a crypto IPO for the project, which would eclipse the need to do a traditional fund raise for a commercial offering. Foundation Basics The foundation will raise money for development through a variety of means, including well defined and transparent corporate sponsored donations, conferences, schwag, feature bounties and more. The Utter.io Foundation will be self-governed and driven exclusively by user and developer participation.  Corporate interests will remain important, especially when considering their contribution to compute resources, but their impact and relationship with the system must remain transparent at all times. Remember, infrastructure was meant to be open, transparent and trustworthy! The Team Kord Campbell I'm originally from Oklahoma. I love creating obscure branding memes and frequently dream about the future of compute. I'm dedicated to developer-centric approaches to marketing products, as I am a developer myself. I code in Python and JavaScript, but I've also been known to write C code for my Arduino. I exited Grub to LookSmart in 2003 (my first visit to the Bay) and did a few other startups before moving back and becoming the Chief Evangelist at Splunk in 2007, where I founded the first Splunk devops conference. In 2009, I founded Loggly and served as the CEO there until 2012. I left the company after coming to an impasse with the board about its future. I'm thankful for the time I've had over the last 2 1/2 years. I've spent most of it focusing on improving my coding skills, doing a bit of OpenStack consulting and thinking about how to apply cryptocurrency trust to the cloud. I also authored and maintain a set of install scripts which have helped about 15K people install OpenStack for evaluation purposes. There is more information about me in my profile and on LinkedIn .  You can find me on Twitter , Github and a couple of blogs I scribble in from time to time. I confess that I wore a pair of house shoes while filming the main video. :) Mauro Stettler Mauro is from Switzerland and travels the world while working. He's a programmer and an OpenStack expert, skilled at building out high availability clusters.  He's on Twitter , Github and LinkedIn as well. Mauro has spent the last year working on Kili , a public cloud deployment of OpenStack in Kenya. He started helping with Utter.io back in August of 2014. \"The main reason why I prefer working on Open Source infrastructure is because I don't need to rely on documentation or support to understand and solve issues.  The best documentation is always the code!\" Advisors We have a few advisors helping us. They come out of companies like Redhat, Cisco, Rackspace, and Microsoft. Their infrastructure experience and grey hairs are helpful in guiding us when it comes to strategy, market positioning and future features. Resources There is a list of current security related features available on Github. Security remains an important risk and challenge to the project. Risks & Challenges The risks involved in the project include meeting developmental deadlines within budget, adequately addressing security issues (link just above this section), maintaining stability of the infrastructure we run for others (like on HPCloud) and a wealth of other software development related issues. There's also the matter of setting up the foundation in a way that is acceptable to all parties involved, including backers, developers, users and providers. Finding a good balance to the foundation's 'knobs' will be critical to the future success of the project. If we run into issues at lower funding levels, the software may not be able completed to everyone's satisfaction. We may need to find alternatives to funding and completing the codebase. Given the project is Open Source, the risk of the project going away completely is greatly minimized. I'd like to thank you if you've read this far.

Today\nthere are numerous types of mining that are suitable for everyone from average PC users with a decent computer to massive companies with server farms\ndedicated to the task.\u00a0 Bitcoin,\nLitecoin, Dogecoin and many others have been in the headlines for what seems\nlike an eternity now - but surprisingly not a single reputable PC case company\nhas come to the table with dedicated cases that have been optimized and\ntailored for mining - and those few \"cases\" (mostly cobbled together\nusing a complex and confusing series of metal rods) that do exist are extremely expensive for what you receive, difficult\nto assemble, and the majority of them are a complete eyesore.\u00a0 Because of the cost vs. value of what is\ncurrently on the market, some people have even gone so far as to use modified\nmilk crates and clothing racks to house their mining rigs.\u00a0 Dopamine aims to solve this problem.</p><p><b>Features include:</b></p><p></p><ul>\n<li>High Quality Materials and Construction - Manufactured in the USA.</li>\n<li>Multi GPU Support - 6 GPU expansion slots</li>\n<li>Spaced Expansion Slots - allow for airflow around GPUs to assist in cooling</li>\n<li>Multiple Form Factor Support - supports mini-ITX, micro-ATX, ATX, and extended ATX motherboards</li>\n<li>Dual Power Supply Support - compatible with all standard ATX power supplies</li>\n<li>Triple 120/140mm Fan Support - provide airflow allowing for assistive ambient cooling</li>\n<li>Built-in PSU Shroud - hide unneeded PSU cables allowing for increased airflow and aesthetics</li>\n<li>Built-in Cable Management - allows only the cables you need to be seen and connected\u00a0\n</li>\n<li>Stackable Design - cases are scalable and can be easily stacked to fit any desired mining setup.\n</li>\n<li>HDD/SSD support - compatible with all standard 2.5\" and 3.5\" drives.</li>\n</ul><div>\n<p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p></div><h3><b></b></h3><p></p><h3><b><b><b><b>No clue what this cryptocurrency mining is all about? \u00a0No Problem!</b></b></b></b></h3><p><b><b>As hard as it is for us to believe sometimes, we realize that there is still a significant number of people who know very little about this subject aside from what they may have seen in news headlines. \u00a0We\u00a0won't get into the myriad of benefits that cryptocurrency mining provides here, but we will say - regardless of whether you buy Dopamine or not, we'd suggest doing a bit of research on the topic to familiarize\u00a0yourself if you haven't. \u00a0A bit of education is never a bad thing right? \u00a0And these days, it's very easy for an average PC user to dive right into mining and start reaping the benefits.</b></b></p><p><b><b>While Dopamine was designed with scalable mining systems in mind, versatility is always a key component of Red Harbinger's cases. \u00a0With that in mind, this case can also easily be built into an open air gaming\u00a0PC, a test bench for hardware testing, or any other type of PC that you can think of. \u00a0Easy access to core components makes upgrading and adding parts a breeze.</b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><b><b><b>What we need &amp; what you get:</b></b></b></h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><b>In order to proceed and be successful with this product, we have to hit an acceptable price point in manufacturing so that we can offer a fair price for the quality of goods that you'll recieve. \u00a0With low\u00a0production quantities, the price per unit increases.

No guardamos bitcoin en los exchange que usamos. A futuro queremos implementar medidas como cuentas multi-firma o integracion con blockchains paralelos (ej. ethereum)\n3.- Actualmente el unico comercio que opera con nosotros es...Broota! Tenemos una estrategia para llegar a comercios fisicos tambien asi como online.\n4.- Hemos realizado algunas averiguaciones y no estamos regulados por ninguna legislaci\ufffdn de valores.

Los felicito y me parece muy atractiva. \n\nMe queda claro que no est\u00e1n regulados. Las plataformas y empresas de servicios financieros tienen una responsabilidad social importante respecto de el uso del dinero para transacciones como el trafico de armas, trafico de personas, narcotrafico, esclavitud, violaciones a los derechos humanos y otros delitos internacionales. Es una responsabilidad moral do todo aquel que este en contra de estos delitos. Esto es clave para los inversionistas ya que al ser socios de Yaykuy tenemos derechos, deberes y responsabilidades. \n\n1- Que politcas tienen al respecto de la prevenci\u00f3n de lavados de activos?\n\n2- Donde se puede consultar el manual de prevencion de lavado de activos?\n\n3- Que sistemas de bases de datos internacionales utilizan para identificar a sospechosos y a PEP?\n\nMe interesa invertir por lo que estar\u00e9 atento a las respuestas y a las propuestas.

Que bueno que te guste lo que estamos haciendo. No podemos estar mas de acuerdo contigo con respecto a la responsabilidad social que implica la operaci\ufffdn de Yaykuy. Si bien aun no tenemos pol\ufffdticas estructuradas con respecto al lavado de activos y el financiamiento del terrorismo y operaciones il\ufffdcitas, si estamos en un camino hacia ello.

Los felicito y me parece muy atractiva. \n\nMe queda claro que no est\u00e1n regulados. Las plataformas y empresas de servicios financieros tienen una responsabilidad social importante respecto de el uso del dinero para transacciones como el trafico de armas, trafico de personas, narcotrafico, esclavitud, violaciones a los derechos humanos y otros delitos internacionales. Es una responsabilidad moral do todo aquel que este en contra de estos delitos. Esto es clave para los inversionistas ya que al ser socios de Yaykuy tenemos derechos, deberes y responsabilidades. \n\n1- Que politcas tienen al respecto de la prevenci\u00f3n de lavados de activos?\n\n2- Donde se puede consultar el manual de prevencion de lavado de activos?\n\n3- Que sistemas de bases de datos internacionales utilizan para identificar a sospechosos y a PEP?\n\nMe interesa invertir por lo que estar\u00e9 atento a las respuestas y a las propuestas.

To rynek globalny. Wzrost liczby transakcji dokonywanych za pomoc\u0105 Bitcoin systematycznie ro\u015bnie.

To nie jest \u0142atwy proces, szczeg\u00f3lnie w \u015brodowisku skomplikowanych przepis\u00f3w prawnych i podatkowych. InPay S.A. nie chce nara\u017ca\u0107 swoich klient\u00f3w dzia\u0142aj\u0105c zgodnie z polskim oraz unijnym prawem.

        "description": "Easbit develops the most granny proof Bitcoin\nwallet for Android smartphones Introduction of ourselves First of all we are obviously very strong believers and real enthusiasts of\nthe Bitcoin. Due to the global crisis and a decreasing trust in the monetary financial\nsystems we believe that the world is in urge of a new and transparent currency\nwhich cannot be interfered and/or be influenced by humans or central banks. Our team has two Dutch co-founders. Our backgrounds lays in banking, IT and\nmarketing. Because of our backgrounds we became truly passionate about\nBitcoins. We have heard from the phenomenon Bitcoin since early 2010. We have\nseen close by how the financial crises emerged. In the news you still hear on a\ndaily base that CEO\u2019s get well overpaid and banks go bankrupt. That is exactly\nwhat we see as very unfair since the normal hard working tax payer has to work\naround the clock and pay eventually for the caused damage. We have a clear vision about what we would like to achieve. Our vision is: Make\ncryptocurrency accessible and easy for everybody by developing granny proof\nsolutions. Our mission is: Proof\nthat we are the best not by saying we are the best, but by reaching top 5 for\nwallet providers in the world. We are ambitious. Because of our individual skills we are an all-round team which is able to\ncover the fields from marketing to actual developing. All the required skills\nare in-house, together with our IT partner in India. Who are the team members? Linkedin: Junanto van der Veen : Core Skills: Project management, IT-developing, Networking, Banking\nand Philosopher Linkedin: Patrick van Ek : Core Skills: Marketing, SEO, Networking, Designing and Philosopher What is this about? We are a startup in software development for cryptocurrency. A granny proof\nand high level security Bitcoin wallet for Android smartphones is the product.\nIt is an Android application for smartphones which enables users to send and\nreceive secured transactions in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. We always keep in\nmind that the usability MUST be as easy as using cash. From\nour perspective this is the only way to get Bitcoin \u201cmainstream\u201d. It is\nnonsense to say that solely this app would achieve this. But we definitely try\nto contribute to this process. Summarizing, the usage of cryptocurrency needs\nto be granny proof and safe in order to go global it is as simple as that! Why the Easbit App? Granny proof: Bitcoin nowadays still has the image of being not user friendly and that\nusage is only meant for IT people. We want to accomplish to get rid of this\nimage for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is meant for everybody around the globe! One thing\nwhich really distinguished ourselves from the competition is that we found a\nvery user friendly way to handle the user unfriendly long Bitcoin addresses.\nTherefore all that counts for us is developing a wallet which meets 100% the\nneeds for all kind of users. Which means: keep it stupid simple! Our goal is\neverybody should be able to use our app. And by everybody we mean everybody who\nuses cash today. Granny proof so to speak. Android smartphones We have consciously decided to develop a wallet for Android based\nsmartphones. We did this for a reason. First of all according to EMarketer.com a smartphone will become more and\nmore globally an essential part of our daily lives, if it isn\u2019t already. So for\nBitcoin it will be extremely important to be easily spendable by a smartphone.\nSecurity again plays here also a major role. A penetration of more than 33% of\nthe global population is estimated to have a smartphone by 2017. On the other hand we have the operating systems (OS). Our aim is that we\nwould like to make our app available for as much people as possible. But we\nalways keep in mind that what we do execute as perfect as possible. We are\ntaking it step by step. So we have chosen to start off with the OS Android.\nSimply because it has the largest market share, it is most widely used and its\nopen source character. Mobile payments Our choice is also based on the future of mobile payments. Technology researcher Gartner forecasts that the worldwide mobile payment\nmarket will have over 450 million users and a transaction value of more than\n$721 billion in 2017. This represents compound annual growth rates of 18% and\n35% respectively for the period 2012 to 2017. Non-US based: Privacy is a big issue. Terms like NSA, spying, malware are common\nheadlines these days. Of course it is not a guarantee, but the majority of the\nBitcoin firms are US-based and we are not. Only 10% is European based and 61%\nUS based (source: Coindesk). It brings in some balance. Security & privacy We are on top of our game when it comes to security. All critical data such\nas keys and exchanged data is encrypted. We will provide easy use for\n(automatic) backup facilities. The safety of your Bitcoins is our highest\npriority. Accenture did a study on mobile payments. When it comes to mobile payments\nthere are 3 things which are important: 1. Security 2. Privacy 3. Convenience (source: Accenture ) We have developed our Android mobile application based on these\nfundamentals. Storage We do not store your Bitcoins (in other words the keys) on a central\nlocation. The main principal of Bitcoin is decentralization. This is a matter\nwe do not like to interfere in. So we do not store any Bitcoin related data on\nour servers. The Bitcoins are stored locally on your own smartphone, just like\nyou carry your own cash in your own wallet. Which means you are ALWAYS really\nin charge of your Bitcoins. Such thing which happened at Mt Gox is simply not\npossible, because we do not store your Bitcoins, private keys, public keys,\npersonal information or any kind of crucial data. We only provide secured\ntransactions and we will be hosting user friendly services to make the usage of\nyour wallet as easy and secure as possible. Backup Of course we have added reliable and secured backup features. As well as\ncold storage and easy restoring in case of losing you smartphone. Developing We develop our software according level 5 CMMI (Capability Maturity Model\nIntegration) standards. We outsource the actual coding in India. The Indian\ncompany is a level 5 organization. Also many other Dutch leading companies are\nengaged with the same company. The company usually engages with larger\ncompanies/customers, but they were also impressed by our ideas for\ncryptocurrency and found it an interesting topic, that is the reason they have\ncommitted themselves to our startup. Level 5 means: It is a characteristic of processes at this level that the\nfocus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental\nand innovative technological changes/improvements. (source: Wikipedia ) Working according the system does not guarantees anything of course. But it\nsays something about the maturity level we develop. It is also important to know is that we code native. The reason we do this\nis that people spend more and more time on their smartphones. Daily activities\ncontain surfing the web, downloading apps, playing games and streaming videos.\nSimply said it is not possible to create the same rich and functional\nexperiences as you would achieve with for e.g. HTML5. What we need & what you get We are currently already developing the application, and approaching final\nstage of development. We have funded the development in the initial phase\nso far by ourselves. In order to finish the application and fully test it we\nneed an additional $25k. We truly hope that you will be our supporter and contribute to our project.\nWe genuinely think that we can contribute to the mainstream process of Bitcoin\nwith our application. Of course we do not stop developing after the first\nrelease. In case of overfunding we will spend it on additional features. We\nhave lots in mind as additional features! Project accounting will be shown at our website: http://www.easbit.com/project-development. The application will be released January. The Impact At a current status only 14% (source: Coindesk) of the companies involved\nin the Bitcoin ecosystem are wallet providers. We think there is still a lot to\ndo to get Bitcoin mainstream. Especially when you think that a wallet is\nbasically an essential need in order to spend your Bitcoins. So it is crucial\npart of the Bitcoin ecosystem. And especially this part of the ecosystem\nrequires granny proof software. A lot is said about Bitcoin. But there is one thing the majority agrees on\nthere is a need for a \u201cKiller-App\u201d. We are convinced that our app can\ncontribute to the mainstream process significantly. It is up to the crowd to\ndecide whether it is a killer app or not. A granny proof and safe app is all\nthat counts for us. Bitcoin is also described as money for nerds. Because of\nits open and transparent character it should be available for everybody with a\nsmartphone. Processing a payment should be easier as swiping your card. That is\nwhat we try to accomplish. Technology is for everybody. Bitcoin may leapfrog credit cards. Due to lack\nof credit cards, approximately 65% and 35% (source: Coindesk) of all e-commerce\nin China and India respectively conducted with cash. Another important feature of the Bitcoin is relatively cheap remittance\ntransactions. Remittance: Average global remittance fee of 8.14% per $200 ($16.28) Bitcoin average transaction fee is $0.004 Remittance vs Bitcoin: Bitcoin is 4,070 times cheaper on a $200\ntransaction. (Source: Coindesk) By using the Easbit app people can send money globally almost instantly\nagainst very low fees comparing to traditional ways. According to Wedbush Securities can (an award-winning research\nplatform) Bitcoin become huge. What is said about Bitcoin? Bitcoin has also attracted the attention of some impressive people. \"[Bitcoin] is a techno tour de force.\"\n- Bill Gates , Founder of Microsoft \u201cWe have elected to put our money and\nfaith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error.\u201d -\nTyler Winklevoss , Co-creator of Facebook \"Bitcoin may be the TCP/IP of money.\"\n- Paul Buchheit , Creator of Gmail \u201c I think the fact that within the bitcoin\nuniverse an algorithm replaces the functions of [the government] \u2026 is actually\npretty cool. I am a big fan of Bitcoin\u201d - Al Gore , 45th Vice\nPresident of the United States \u201cI do think Bitcoin is the first\n[encrypted money] that has the potential to do something like change the\nworld.\" - Peter Thiel , Co-Founder of Paypal \"Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic\nachievement and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the\ndigital world has enormous value\" - Eric Schmidt , CEO of Google Risk & Challenges There is no project without risks. And so is ours. But we did our homework.\nAlmost half a year of preparation, maturing our idea, writing a marketing and\nbusiness plan, preparing the granny proof design, user friendly functionalities\nwent by before we actually started coding. This was an essential part to get\nthe best user experience there possibly is. So we are at least convinced that\nwe did all we could within our powers. It is not only the developing that we\nfocus on. We also have the proper skills when it comes to market the app. This\npart is at least as important to become successful. An awesome marketing plan\nis also part of the whole project. If people can\u2019t find you, you can\u2019t expect\nthem to use your app! A risk for projects in general is budgeting. Due to our preparations we are\nconvinced we have defined our costs cautiously. As we said we are currently\nalready developing and costs are lower than initially expected because of\noffshoring to India. Because of the months of preparations we are absolutely sure when we meet\nour funding needs we can show the world the first release in January. How to contribute to the Easbit Crowdfunding Campaign?

We need funding to build modern, high-tech \u00a0iOS and Android apps. The main part of our audience\u00a0(currently 60% - this figure is constantly growing) comes from mobile devices. That means that these apps can become the tool that will help people interested in the future of money and cryptocurrencies read the latest news in the most convenient way. What We Need & What You Get We will spend gained investments on: - Google and Apple development enrollments - 124$ - Design - 1100$ - Programming (includes page-proofs and publishing) - 1900$ These are the costs of the designer and programmer that we discovered and took on board recently. They are highly qualified and have seriously impressive portfolios, and we are sure they will provide results and meet our expectations. What you get: If we get more: If we get more than 3124$, \u00a0we will spend them on writing interesting, stand-out articles! If we get less: If we fail to collect 3124$ we will continue to seek funds until we achieve the required amount. The fact is that we want a great app, and everyone should love it! We are the leaders in the field and we can't afford to let our users down, which is why we need to achieve the above figure as a minimum.

Definitely! What is our plan? According to the plans drawn up by our specialists (designer and programmer), the process of building two apps will take around 3 and a half months. Here is the plan: 1. App for iOS - Design creation for both operation systems (3 weeks) - First app compilation and fixes (2 weeks) - Second app compilation and fixes (1 week) - Final Compilation, adapting the designs for all devices and fixes ( 1 week) - Publication (up to 1 week) 2. App for Android The same operations except the design, which we just need to adapt it for Android devices. Moreover, publishing the app on the Google Play Market takes just a few hours. If our specialists fail to meet the deadlines, they pay fines. (3% per day), so they are motivated to keep to the schedule. As a result, the apps are to be a success!",

        "description": "<div>\n<h2>The story of the project</h2><div>**UPDATE**We are aware of the increasing difficulty with mining bitcoin, difficulty greatly affects the amount of bitcoins hardware can mine based on its performance. We want to ensure our contributors / pledgers that we have an exit strategy in place to mine alternative coin types so that we can continue to operate with profits and yield results.Our exit strategy will be PPC or PeerCoin unless another Alt Coin can yield more profits using ASIC hardware.We are a Bitcoin Mining startup with profit share contract opportunities. Unlike other online bitcoin mining services our contracts are for the life of our mining venture, which means contract owners will continue to earn a share of the NET bitcoin profits based on their purchased share percentage for the specified round. The contract will continue until the day we decide mining is no longer profitable and turn off the power to the hardware.We are already invested in mining with low performance hardware at a rate of 14 Gh/s and a combined cloud mining contract performance of 50 Gh/s.Our first round of mining hardware has already been purchased using capital from private investors ( mostly friends, family members and our selves ) We have purchased $30,000.00 AUD worth of hardware from our supplier in the US and expect delivery by March 2014. Our additional costs for that round will include customs duties and taxes on arrival and hardware set-up costs which will bring the total close to $40,000.00 AUDThe performance of the first round of mining hardware is estimated to be 6,000 Gh/s ( + / - 20% )</div><h2>How the funds will be used</h2><div>Our expected costsWe will be purchasing a second round of hardware asap to allow for improved performance on our mining venture.The hardware will cost $50,000.00 AUD ( 20 x 600 Gh/s mining cards at $2,500 AUD each ) with an estimated total performance of approx 20,000 Gh/s ( + / - 20% )Our expected customs duties and tax should be $5,000.00 AUD ( 10% of the hardware value )Our final cost to setup the gear and start mining is in the computer hardware that the mining cards get installed into. This cost would be approx $5,000.00 AUD ( 10 x basic performance computers )Profit calculationsUsing the following bitcoin calculator website the current estimated return on $60,000.00 AUD for 20,000 Gh/s for twelve months of constant mining is approx $1,200,000.00 AUD providing the current value of one bitcoin is $1,000 AUD.http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/If bitcoin continues to increase in value and performs as expected with its already trending rise then this estimated value could multiply into a larger return.Project services once runningOnce we have finished setting up the project and are successfully mining we will begin to offer purchasable services from our hardware setup.Contract miningWe will be offering a contracted service to deliver to our customers a % of the mining performance for $1,000 AUD. The contract is for the life of the mining project and will terminate when the project becomes unprofitable to continue running. We will reserve the right to make this judgement based on our experience and understanding of the bitcoin technology. We estimate to be running at least 12 months. These contracted services are eligible for redemption tokens which will receive up to 99% discounts on single quantity purchases. We are offering these tokens as rewards to our supporters who pledge $1,000 to the project.</div><h2>Some of my other work</h2><div>We have our website set-up indicating our current round one of mining hardware and this same website will be used to display the rounds performance and returns for the round one a weekly basis.http://www.ozbitcoinminers.com.au</div><h2>Challenges</h2><div>RisksIf the value of bitcoin falls below $65 AUD and remains less than this for an indefinite period of time then the return would be less than the invested capital on the hardware purchased. however bitcoin has been constantly above $700 for the past 6 months and does not show any signs of falling so this risk, although still a risk is very unlikely.ChallengesOnce the hardware arrives we need to set-up and have the hardware running as soon as possible to pursuit a break even on the hardware investment, we estimate a break even about 14 days into mining but will allow for a 30 day mining period to ensure break even.Power consumption is another consideration and we would need to ensure the venture is constantly powered and profitable... if there is a sign that its not profitable then we would need to consider relocating the hardware into a scenario / location that would allow for profitability or consider shutting down the venture.</div>\t</div>",

The\ncamps create the platform for young Africans to discover the philosophy of\nLiberty, and gain knowledge of entrepreneurship skills. In an era where youth\nunemployment has become a chronic headache in Africa as a result of weak\nEconomic Liberty. The camp offers a rare opportunity for the youth to start\nbusinesses &amp; institutions for political reforms.\n</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>\nNorthern Ghana is the poorest part of the country. Although there\u2019s rich land inabundance,\n people cannot leverage their land to, for instance, borrow money for \neducation or starting businesses, or secure it for their children or \nspouses if something happens, because they have\u00a0<b>no land titles to prove the ownership</b>\u00a0of the land. This creates a lack of financial mobility, and often violent conflicts.\u00a0<b>Land titles can be done on the Bitcoin blockchain</b>,\n at a very minimal costs, and without the involvement of centralized \ninstitutions. It's an unprecedented opportunity to free millions of \npeople from poverty.\n<p>\n\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\nTherefore our <b>Summer Camp</b> is focusing on how the Blockchain Technology can be used to issue land titles. It will take place from<b> July 19 - 23, 2015</b> in the Northern City of Tamale (Pronounced Tamal3) and the theme is <i><b>'Liberating Northern Ghana Economically: The Blockchain to the Rescue\u2019</b></i>.\n</p><div>\n<h3>The Impact</h3>\n<p>\n</p></div><p>We are working together with BITNATION,\n the traditional rulers, and the\u00a0people of the North to use the \nBlockchain Technology to issue land titles in the north this year. <b>BITNATION has completed the first Land Title Test on the Bitcoin Blockchain in Ghana</b>,\n and is working together with Ilocater, a Danish Land Survey company, to\n find the best model to build the BITLAND DApp including cheap survey \nequipment, which will be available on the BITNATION platform.\u00a0AYPC will \neducate the youth, so they can do these DIY Governance blockchain \napplications themselves.\u00a0</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><div>Throughout the week participants will learn entrepreneurship \nskills, explore the social and economic benefits of a secure private \nproperty regime, coupled with land titles, corporate incorporation, \nsmart contracts and more, and how the Blockchain Technology can deliver \nthat on the cheap. They will be assisted to draw an Action Plan to \neducate their communities to facilitate their cooperation and smooth \nimplementation of the Land Title Project.<p>\n</p><p>\n\u00a0Our Blockchain Titles Ambassadors will form a network to educate \nthe communities about the Bitcoin Blockchain Technology, and how to use \nit. Time will be set aside as Cryptocurrency/Blockchain Business \nOpportunities Day. This will enable participants to explore the business\n side of Bitcoin/Blockchain, and how to start their own profitable \nventures with it.</p>\n<p>Movement like Prof. <b>Steve Horwitz</b>, <b>Roger Ver</b> (BitCoin Jesus),<b> Susanne Tarkowski\u00a0Templehof</b>, Dr. <b>Tom G.

Well, I'm with you there, my name is Gustaf and I've got a disease...\n\n           (Warning: Controversial content, skip paragraph if you can\u2019t handle the truth.)\n         Every night I lie in bed for hours kept awake by the stark paradox within which I live. I am consumed by an ineffable idea. The idea that the truth is simple and the simple truth is that we are not free. I know we\u2019d like to believe that we are, and sometimes comfort and security feel like they are, but the truth is they are only cheap sedatives. Freedom is a simple and powerful concept and up till now,  has proven difficult  to uphold economically. However there is finally something that looks a whole lot better because before Bitcoin, broken economies are all that we've bloody-well known :)\n \n               You and I both know that digital currency promises an independent, better future but how many of your friends know this, 10%? 5%? 1%? The reality is that the Bitcoin community is still very small, far too small to be confident of its survival. And this is my goal, I want to facilitate and accelerate Bitcoin's global adoption through educational media. I wrote a book called, \"The idiot's Guide to Bitcoin\" and I am working on a new version to be published which will go to print under the name, \"Bitcoin -  A Citizen's guide\"\n \n             It all started about two years ago, a mention in passing of a revolutionary entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto and his/her/their brainchild Bitcoin. It took a while for me to fully grasp the implication of what had been said but when the moment arrived, and I had crawled out from under that cosmic ton of bricks, I had finally found a channel for all my energy. I immediately committed to spreading the good word of Bitcoin. It was a little while later that I decided that the best way to do this was to write a book that promotes Bitcoin and makes it easy for everyone and anyone to get involved. I finished \u201cthe Idiot\u2019s Guide to Bitcoin\u201d ebook about two months ago and released it for purchase @ www.idiotsguidetobitcoin.com\n \n \n       The Idiot's Guide to Bitcoin is, as the name suggests, an every-man's guide to the digital currency known as Bitcoin. I  believe it is a vital contribution to the Bitcoin ecosystem and so do many others. The book has received so much support since I launched it and I just want to thank you all for that. Writing and promoting the book has been a tremendously fulfilling experience especially because I've been blown away by how positive and encouraging the Bitcoin community has been. Being at ground zero for the rise of Bitcoin has been a privilege as well as just plain incredible. Never before have I encountered such a concentration of the most innovative, enlightened and inspiring individuals. As a good friend of mine put it: \"Innovation comes from the edges, so it comes as no surprise that innovators are found in the margins. They are the misfits among us, the ones who see and do things differently.\" We have discovered great power in Bitcoin and as such we have a duty to protect and nourish it. As pioneers on a new frontier it is our responsibility as Bitcoiners to ensure the future of Bitcoin and what a bright future it is!\n\n               So why am I asking you to fund a book that\u2019s already available. Well, <em>the Idiot\u2019s Guide to Bitcoin </em>is currently only in a digital form and is exclusively available from my little website. I want to turn it into something better, so to be honest there is still much work to be done but I\u2019m an independent writer and have reached the end of my resources.  In other words, I need all the help I can get to get it properly published.\n \n               It\u2019s time for the book to get the propulsion it deserves. It needs to be published and promoted on a global scale. If you\u2019re already part of the Bitcoin sphere, which I assume you are as you've read this far, then by helping me to publish my book you help support a global endeavour to further the Bitcoin cause and in so doing you guard your own interests. Every Bitcoin start-up, every Bitcoin investment, every miner, buyer, spender, freelancer, apologist, the entire Bitcoin network will benefit from an increased global awareness and facilitated global adoption as well as reference literature. So I passionately ask you to help me publish my book and help me spread the good word of Bitcoin.\n </div><h2>How the funds will be used</h2><div>The most important result of a successful Pozible campaign will be making the book appealing and easily accessible to a significant amount of people. The Target of $15000 will comfortably but exclusively ensure this result. This will include:\n \n         - Subscription to Print-on-demand services that will see that the book never goes out of print.\n         - Worldwide distribution to a multitude of online bookstores including Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Fishpond etc.\n         - Professional Editing\n         - Professional criticisms and advice\n         - 400 copies for sale in Bitcoin\n         - Dedicated Website upgrade.\n         - Limited PR campaign\n \n       To professionally promote and advertise the book we will have to exceed our target. It is not essential to the long term success of the project to successfully raise enough money to launch a full scale PR blitzkreig but it sure will make it happen a hell of a lot quicker. A decent start would be $10,000.\n \n </div><h2>Challenges</h2><div>To be honest it's just a question of continuing the work I've already been doing. The main obstacle to persistence is a lack of resources which is why we're here on Pozible in the first place, should the campaign be successful then there shouldn't be too much to worry about in terms of making the book available. The costs of publishing are accurately covered in the target of $15000. The words are down and illustrations done. I will however significantly expand the new edition and it will probably be called \"Bitcoin - A Citizen's Guide\" but as I mentioned it's just a question of continuing the work I've been doing and if the \"Make It Pozible\" campaign is successful I will be able to do so.</div>\t</div>",

        "description": "We're raising money for a peer-to-peer marketplace that will revolutionize the way e-commerce is done. Contributors will receive OmniCoins to spend in the OmniBazaar marketplace. We already have a working Windows prototype of the software. Donations will fund further development of O mniBazaar and OmniCoin software . Please watch the videos and read the campaign. Seen On: OmniBazaar -- Removing Middlemen and Bankers from E-commerce OmniBazaar is a new type of e-commerce marketplace that removes the middlemen and bankers from e-commerce . OmniBazaar will allow users to buy and sell directly among themselves (rather than through a middleman site like Amazon or eBay), using Bitcoin and OmniCoin (instead of credit cards or PayPal). By using a distributed structure to eliminate the middlemen, and using Bitcoin and OmniCoin to eliminate the bankers, OmniBazaar will be able to charge users about 80% lower fees than existing e-commerce sites like eBay and Amazon. OmniBazaar will also serve the 2.5 billion \"un-banked\" people world-wide who cannot use existing e-commerce sites, because those sites require users to have credit cards and bank accounts. Participants anywhere in the world will be able to buy and sell in the OmniBazaar marketplace without bank accounts, credit cards, application forms, or credit checks , using only their computer , smartphone, or tablet. Individuals and small businesses will transact business among themselves using a free version of the OmniBazaar software to list and shop for products and services. Users will pay no fees to join the marketplace, no fees to shop or post listings , and no monthly or annual membership fees . Users will pay only a small (~1%) fee on each transaction to support service providers in the marketplace network. The marketplace technology to accomplish this has been designed, programmed, and a working prototype created. Funding we receive in this campaign will enable us to complete the development of OmniCoin and the OmniBazaar marketplace software. Screen shots from our working prototype Windows application: Our Mission We are creating a new economic and financial system \u201cof the people, by the people, for the people\u201d . We are enabling e-commerce without the middleman, and payment without bankers. We are building a secure, efficient, decentralized, online marketplace, where individuals trade directly with other individuals , instead of with multinational corporations. Participants will use currency based on mathematics and technology , instead of belief in a central government, and interact within a monetary system based on production and assets , instead of debt created by central banks. Our Values Individual liberty, Internet privacy, market freedom, and financial responsibility Building a sustainable, asset-based, independent economic system Bringing e-commerce to half the world's population who don't have bank accounts Getting cryptocurrencies into broad use by average people around the world Encouraging and promoting local, mobile, and social commerce CryptoBazaar -- Enabling Anonymous E-commerce The CryptoBazaar upgrade for the OmniBazaar software will allow you to buy and sell anonymously through the OmniBazaar marketplace, by using advanced software that can \"cloak\" your computer's internet address, and allow you to preserve as much personal privacy as you choose. The CryptoBazaar upgrade will include access to a peer-to-peer escrow service , provided cooperatively by other CryptoBazaar users, that will allow secure transactions between buyers and sellers who don't know or trust each other. CryptoBazaar will also provide a secure, escrowed, distributed  cryptocurrency  exchange . Imagine being able to buy and sell  cryptocurrencies  without relying on a centralized exchange. New Currency for a New Marketplace OmniCoin (XOM) is the digital currency of the OmniBazaar marketplace. People will use Bitcoins and OmniCoins to buy and sell goods and services in the OmniBazaar marketplace. The value of OmniCoins will \u201cfloat\u201d freely compared to other currencies, and the value of OmniCoins will be based on the value of the goods and services they can buy in the marketplace. OmniCoin is simple and secure to use. It is privacy-friendly , because it allows you to choose to conduct transactions that are either transparent or anonymous. Transaction processing takes seconds instead of minutes, so OmniCoin is business-friendly . Transaction processing uses relatively little computing power, so OmniCoin is eco-friendly . And, with OmniCoin, you can do transactions using an account name instead of a string of numbers. This makes OmniCoin user-friendly. Beginning at the launch of OmniBazaar and OmniCoin, we will start giving away all 20,000,000,000 OmniCoins to users of the OmniBazaar marketplace. Each new user will receive a few thousand OmniCoins when they register, and additional coins when they refer a friend or do transactions in the marketplace. We want tens or hundreds of millions of people to eventually become owners of OmniCoin and users of the OmniBazaar marketplace. So, we will give away billions of coins to millions of people who join, refer their friends, do transactions in the marketplace, and provide the services and infrastructure for the marketplace. In the beginning, OmniCoins will be free. But, as thousand, millions, or billions of people use them in the OmniBazaar marketplace, OmniCoins will find a value, as any currency does, based on the confidence people have that they can use OmniCoin to purchase valuable goods and services. OmniCoin Features Easy Addresses: Send/Receive to an account name, not a number Privacy: Transfer Invisibly To Any Name (TITAN) Distributed Escrow Anonymous Chat Internet Address Obfuscation User Reputation System Technical Specifications Blockchain Security: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) Total Supply: 20,000,000,000 Block Reward: From transaction fees Block Time: ~10 seconds Initial PoW Period: None Distribution Percentage: 100% Emission Rate: Based on the number of new users and number of transactions. Developer Hold-back: None Investor Repayments: None Other Distribution: The \"perks\" from this crowd-funding campaign Distribution Period : As long as it takes Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why create another cryptocurrency? Why not just use Bitcoin? There are several reasons. Bitcoin is not particularly anonymous, so we are designing OmniCoin to be more private . An address for receiving Bitcoin looks like this: 15r8p9bbciYyjn3Jo1o4UEne7XKAXPCTM3 , while an address for receiving OmniCoin looks like this: Alice_B . Bitcoin takes up to an hour to generate six confirmations of validity for a transaction, whereas OmniCoin will generate six confirmations in under a minute. Confirming Bitcoin transactions is very energy-intensive, but confirming OmniCoins is done using a small fraction of the energy and a fraction of the time. OmniCoin is also designed to be better than Bitcoin at accommodating the \"micro-payment\" transactions that will occur when marketplace service providers are paid a small percentage of the transaction fees from a transaction. We're also building OmniCoin with a simple, automated escrow feature that doesn't exist in other Bitcoin wallets, and a reputation tracking feature that doesn't exist anywhere in Bitcoin (that we know of). Finally, by creating a token specifically for the OmniBazaar marketplace we believe we can make the marketplace more useful and robust. Having said all that, we are building OmniBazaar to operate with both Bitcoin and OmniCoin. Wait a minute! Are you saying you plan to dump 20 billion OmniCoins onto the market when OmniBazaar launches? No. Absolutely not. The number of coins in circulation will be completely determined by how many people join and use the OmniBazaar marketplace. We will give only a small (relative to the eventual 20 billion) number of coins to each person who joins OmniBazaar, and an even smaller number of coins for referring a friend. We will distribute half the coins in this manner, over the span of as many months or years as it takes to distribute them all. We will distribute the other 10 billion coins as \"reverse transaction fees\" when users conduct transactions with each other in the marketplace. In other words, during the initial distribution period, we will essentially pay users a small OmniCoin bonus to buy or sell something in the marketplace. We haven't finalized the numbers yet, but let's say we give 1,000 OmniCoins to each new user who joins OmniBazaar. This represents one twenty-millionth (1/20,000,000) of the total eventual coin supply. That would be a much slower emission rate than most other coins have. We could give 10,000 coins to each new user and still have a slow emission rate. We think this is infinitely more rational and fair than most other recently introduced cryptocurrencies (especially the ones that generate all the coins in just a few weeks to enrich the developers and their friends). And we believe this distribution plan will add liquidity at the rate that is needed by the marketplace . As more people join, more OmniCoins will come into circulation. Similarly, we estimate that users will do hundreds of millions of transactions in the marketplace before the \"reverse transaction fee\" pool of coins is completely distributed. How can OmniCoins have value if you are giving them away? When most cryptocurrencies launch, they make a point of promoting the wonderful new features of the coin itself, with the idea that those features are somehow the basis of its value. We are taking a completely different (and radical) approach. We believe that the value of any currency lies only in the confidence people have that it can be used , today or in the near future, to acquire valuable goods and services. People can come to perceive a unit of currency as an investment, if they believe it will be more useful (valuable) in the future. But that is a different concept than its value (usefulness) as a currency today. We are giving away 20 billion OmniCoin to emphasize the fact that any cryptocurrency, by itself , is absolutely worthless. It is nothing more than some bits and bytes pushed across the Internet. Only the usefulness of a cryptocurrency gives it any value. So, we are creating a simple, secure, cooperative, distributed marketplace where OmniCoins can easily be used, and allowing OmniCoin to find its own value. If we do a good job of making the marketplace easy, safe, and inexpensive to use, and create OmniCoin with advanced features that make it useful in that marketplace, we feel certain that both OmniBazaar and OmniCoin will prosper. The price of OmniCoins may be low in the beginning. But, the more they become useful (and are used), the higher the value (and price) will become. Why charge transaction fees for services? If the marketplace is cooperative, why isn't it free? Without charges for consumers of services, and incentives for providers of services, the OmniBazaar marketplace would experience a phenomenon known as the \"tragedy of the commons\" . The creator of Bitcoin avoided this problem, with respect to transaction processing and network security, by providing a financial incentive for the Bitcoin \"miners\" who provide these services. OmniBazaar extends this concept to also include incentives for those who publish listings for others, provide escrow services, facilitate privacy in the network, etc. We strongly believe that without such a system of fees and incentives, a marketplace economic system like OmniBazaar would fail, due to the \"tragedy of the commons\". There is an open-source distributed marketplace project under development that aims to operate without any fees. We believe this effort is doomed to fail for the reasons given above. How will the developers benefit? The development team is a \"service provider\" in the marketplace, just like the Publishers, Escrow Agents, Promoters, and Privacy Facilitators. So, the developers will receive a portion of the transaction fees from marketplace transactions, just like other service providers. We are planning for that fee to be one fourth of one percent (0.25%) for both buyers and sellers. And yes, we are planning to make it mandatory -- at least in the beginning. We understand that some people may be incensed (or even enraged) by this. But we believe that most users of the marketplace will consider it reasonable and fair. After all, OmniBazaar will save sellers about 80% of the fees they would pay if they sell on Amazon or eBay. This will naturally also result in lower prices for buyers. How will you avoid criminals and terrorists? We believe people are basically good, and that the vast majority of people have no interest in engaging in criminal activities. So, we are focused on protecting the rights and privacy of the honest majority, instead of worrying about the criminal few. Attempts to \"stop criminals\" have too often been used as an excuse to decrease personal privacy and freedoms. We are building into OmniBazaar a self-policing system that will allow users to flag prohibited content. If a product receives a certain number of flags, that product will (essentially) be removed from the system. We have also designed a \"reputation\" system that will penalize sellers who list prohibited content. We have designed OmniBazaar to be a better alternative to Amazon and eBay, not to be the next Silk Road. When did the OmniBazaar/OmniCoin/CryptoBazaar project start? The first complete technical description of the peer-to-peer shopping marketplace concept was published in August, 2013 . OmniBazaar Inc. was incorporated in September 2013, to develop the project. By December 2013 we put together our core team, had a Private Placement Offering ready, further developed the technology, created two videos describing the project, and generated various marketing materials. In January 2014, we introduced OmniBazaar and the cooperative distributed marketplace concept at \"Bitcoin Miami\". Since that time, we have been working largely \"under the radar\", and have now programmed the core marketplace application and the wallet for OmniCoin. Why donate? Would you like to pay less for stuff when you shop on-line? Do you believe in personal privacy and individual liberty? Would you like to help us bring e-commerce to half of the world's population? Do you support the development and use of alternative currencies? If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, please show your support with a donation of any size. Why $50,000? We are raising this money to complete the development of OmniCoin and the OmniBazaar software. We need to hire several programmers to complete various parts of the project. Good programmers are expensive, and we need good programmers. We're close to releasing OmniCoin and OmniBazaar, but there is still some programming left to do. Achieving our goal here in the crowd-funding phase will allow us to complete the release versions of OmniCoin and the marketplace software. That will help us raise the rest of the money to make the marketplace successful. It will also show potential equity investors that we have community interest and user support . (If you are a \"rock-star\" programmer, and believe OmniCoin and OmniBazaar are exciting, please contact us. You might be able to help us revolutionize the way e-commerce is done.) Our Part We are a \"lean\" start-up with minimal over-head and expenses. We are moving fast and practice efficient \"agile\" software development. Funds we raise will be placed in a multi-signature Bitcoin address, publicly viewable on the blockchain, for administrative transparency. We will communicate our progress and listen to our backers. Your Part Contribute to the development of OmniCoin and the OmniBazaar software. Donate money to help us build a new type of free-market economy. Help us promote the \"grass-root\" usage of cryptocurrencies by ordinary people. Support our crusade for a sane, sustainable financial system. Fund us  to show your support for e-commerce privacy.

Click here. Notices OmniCoins are digital tokens that will be used by buyers and sellers in the OmniBazaar marketplace. The OmniBazaar marketplace has not been launched, and OmniCoins do not yet exist. When OmniCoins are released, they will have no \"par value\", and will never represent any ownership, voting rights, control, or dividends in OmniBazaar Inc., the OmniBazaar marketplace, or any other asset. At the time of launch, and for many months thereafter, OmniCoins will be given away free to users of the OmniBazaar marketplace. OmniCoins as \"perks\" cannot, therefore, be considered a \"financial incentive\". The financial value of OmniCoins will be essentially zero, and might never increase. Any value that OmniCoins do eventually develop will be based on their usefulness in the OmniBazaar marketplace. If you choose to receive OmniCoins as your \"perk\" in this crowd-funding campaign, you acknowledge that you understand you are making a donation, not an investment . OmniCoins may never be more than a \"token\" of our appreciation for your support. Risks and challenges The OmniBazaar software is at the prototype stage of development. The images on this page are actual screen shots from the functioning version of the prototype. OmniCoin is still also still under development. The images (coming soon) on this page are actual screen shots of the wallet, but that wallet is not yet completely functional. OmniBazaar Inc. has been developing OmniBazaar and OmniCoin for over a year. We are building OmniBazaar and OmniCoin using technology and algorithms that have already been proven to work. We have a team of talented developers, each of whom is an expert in his field. We are therefore confident in our ability to complete the project as it has been described here. The following tasks remain to complete OmniBazaar and OmniCoin: Program, test and debug the OmniCoin multi-signature distributed escrow system. Program, test and debug the OmniBazaar/OmniCoin distributed user reputation system. Create \u201clite\u201d clients for Windows, OSX, Android, and iPhone. Compile full-node executables for Linux and OSX. Integrate IP obfuscation for complete anonymity. Integrate \u201cOmniChat\u201d secure communication module. Increase scalability of the OmniBazaar distributed database. Design and program the OmniCoin initial distribution system. Risks: Our software design, engineering, and test processes are rigorous and focused on producing high quality, well tested products. As we move towards final integration and testing of OmniBazaar and OmniCoin, we may learn that additional revision is needed to meet our quality standards. This may delay the delivery schedule. The remaining tasks may take longer than expected to complete. The rate at which we are able to complete the remaining tasks to launch OmniBazaar and OmniCoin will be determined to a considerable extent by the success of this IndieGoGo campaign. Meeting or exceeding our goal will allow us to launch more quickly. More Information If you would like more information about the technology behind OmniBazaar and CryptoBazaar, click here .",

Simply hand-assemble your private sentence from the supplied letter-blocks, enclose the data in the cold wallet and rest-assured of its safety.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div><b>click here to contribute in Bitcoin<p>\n</p><p>\n</p></b><p><b></b></p></div>Cryptosteel is fireproof, corrosion-resistant, acid-resistant and virtually uncrushable. Furthermore, the fact that the wallet operates entirely offline means that, unlike engraved plates with a QR code, no third party can access the owner\u2019s personal data.<p>\n\n\n</p><p>\nCryptosteel is the result of a long process of design evolution through which our innovative team endeavoured to marry the enduring typographical legacies of the Renaissance Gutenberg Press with the material robustness of a military dog tag.</p>\n\n<p>\nHuman history has consistently demonstrated that one cannot rely on hard drives or electronic devices to safe-guard their private information and all of the world\u2019s biggest, ostensibly most reliable institutions are prone to dissolution. In this context Cryptosteel is marked out as an ideal confidential information storage-system: even the worst disasters cannot destroy the cold wallet\u2019s stainless steel construction (AISI 304).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The wallet thus stands to benefit bitcoin and non-bitcoin users alike. Cryptosteel functions as an ideal place to store passwords of any kind as well as confidential family information.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Think of the artefact as like a readily-accessible safe deposit box: you decide what goes in and out and you are the only one who can make any changes. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The essence of Cryptosteel is <b>peace of mind</b>, and the security benefits of the wallet have only been enhanced as a result of our recent collaboration with the world-leading bitcoin security specialists, SatoshiLabs. As Cryptosteel Inventor,\u00a0 Wojciech Stopinski, observed:\u00a0</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf we want to become our own banks, we need to protect our assets. That's where Trezor and Cryptosteel come in. Together we have created the <b>everlasting bitcoin safe.</b> SatoshiLabs took the original design and functionality of Cryptosteel and upgraded it, making it even better and with increased benefits to user\"</i></p><p></p><p>\n</p><p>Cryptosteel comes with more than 250 stainless steel letter blocks engraved on each side. Users are able to store up to 96 characters worth of confidential information in the cold wallet in minutes, guaranteeing the data\u2019s safety without the need for specialized tools.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the fact that storing information in Cryptosteel requires no third-party contact (even with us) means the user remains in full control of their own anonymity as well as the security of their data is throughout the process.</p><p>\n\n</p><h2>Final Product, you are pledging for:</h2>\n<p></p><p></p><p>\n\n</p><ul>\n<li>Container for up to 96 characters + more than 250 stainless steel letter blocks</li>\n<li>Master Mnemonic Seed BIP39 Ready</li>\n<li>\nPrivate, off-line storage for private keys and passwords\n</li>\n<li>\nLightweight, stainless steel\n</li>\n<li>\nIndestructible, acid\u00adresistant, and uncrushable\n</li>\n<li>\nFireproof up to 1200 C, or 2100 F\n</li>\n<li>\nOpen-Hardware: blueprints available under CC License\n</li>\n<li>\nCompatibility: Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies\n</li>\n<li>No tools necessary</li>\n<li>Made in Poland</li>\n</ul><p>In this respect the artefact is ideal for use in the context of ultra-secure setups involving multisig wallets. As Director of SatoshiLabs, Alena Vranova, pointed out: \u00a0\"<i>Cryptosteel will come to be used as an <b>\u201ceternal backup\u201d</b> for future generations, adding that the cold wallet \u201crepresents an advanced form of the TREZOR Recovery seed card. it\u2019s anonymous, offline and confidential but moreover, it\u2019s really durable, resistant to fire or water.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i><i>\n\n</i></i></p><h2><i><i>Why are we crowdfunding?</i></i></h2><i><i>\n<p>Bitcoin users made this product for the Bitcoin community.</p><p></p><p>We are collecting funds for special tools for our assembly lines.

We believe that we have come up with the solution.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Cryptosteel is an <b>Open Source</b> project and full blueprints will be made available on an <b>Open Hardware</b> basis.

Being \"not mined\" means that the only people to control Rimbit is the community.<b>Not mined? Then how is Rimbit verified and confirmed?</b>With Bitcoin miners verify and confirm transactions.With Rimbit, the community confirm and verify transactions.Every Rimbit wallet, apart from Android wallets has an option that lets the wallet perform verification and confirmations for the network, as long as a wallet is online and allowed to do those 2 functions.Inside the Rimbit core code is a function that allows the wallet to know when it is online and helping the network perform transactions and when it has successfully assisted the network, the wallet will then internally issue \"stake\" back to itself in form of newly created Rimbit. This Stake is set at 5% per annum and is created by the users wallet and deposited directly back into the users wallet. (Some news outlets cannot grasp this simple process and negatively report otherwise)Bitcoin is finite, meaning that there will only be 25 million coins ever in existence.Rimbit has the \"stake\" function and will allow new Rimbit to be created at a maximum increase at 5% per year, which means it will grow as more users start using Rimbit<b>How is Rimbit development different to Bitcoin?</b>Bitcoin develops its core code via donations to the project. That is why Bitcoin is essentially broke! http://www.geek.com/news/the-bitcoin-foundation-is-essentially-broke-says-new-board-member-1619795/Rimbit pays its developers via a percentage of the income generated via selling of Rimbit to the public, so as more Rimbit is sold, so increases the development of Rimbit.</p><p>\n</p><h2>Get a Wallet</h2>\n<p>Rimbit Wallets are free and we use contributions from users to update \n  and improve wallets as it is our policy to put funds directly back into \n  the continued development of the Rimbit Ecosystem!\n</p>\n<p>\n</p><p></p><h2>Rimbit is the ONLY Digital Currency that can survive long term. PERIOD!\n</h2>Rimbit was built by Bitcoin users, who saw the issues confronting Bitcoin and we have been warning Bitcoin users for a long time, but it has fallen on deaf/greedy ears and the only solution we could come up with was to instead build a Digital Currency and fix the issues, as controversial and misunderstood as it may seem.It is now that the media is starting to heed our warnings and reporting on the issues we have been presenting to the Bitcoin community, well before Rimbit was built.http://www.coindesk.com/five-biggest-threats-facing-bitcoin/<b>In another well respected article - Quote:</b><i>Once seen as a better investment than gold, the digital cryptocurrency is experiencing some severe existential threats.</i>Source: http://www.newstatesman.com/future-proof/2015/01/slowly-surely-bitcoin-appears-be-falling-apartRimbit is Bitcoin with the mining removed.

        "description": "I am creating the course that I would have wanted to take when I\nfirst became interested in Bitcoin, and writing and publishing a\ncompanion e-book and zine entitled \u201cBYOB: Using Bitcoin to Be Your\nOwn Bank.\u201d After spending the last two years learning about bitcoin\nfrom the brightest minds in the industry and teaching this knowledge\nto others through my website bitcoinconsultant.me, I've decided to\nbring this knowledge to Kickstarter, just in time for the holidays.\nWhether you make it your New Year's Resolution to learn about bitcoin, or want to pass the gift of knowledge and monetary freedom\nalong to someone you care about, this course and e-book will be a\ngreat way for beginners to learn about bitcoin. What material will be covered? Learn about what bitcoin is, how it works, why it's important, and\nhow to use bitcoin to take control of your money and \u201cBe Your Own\nBank.\u201d We will go step-by-step through the process of creating a\nwallet, buying and selling bitcoins, and storing bitcoins in a way\nthat will protect them from online hackers. Students will also learn\nhow to use bitcoin for non-monetary purposes, such as the secure\ntimestamping of documents and other digital files. How is this different than the courses and books already available? While there are several great books and online courses out there that do a great job at explaining what bitcoin is and telling its story, none have been focused on practical uses for bitcoin (that I know of, anyway). This is where BYOB is unique. The BYOB online course and companion book will still introduce students to the basic history and technical concepts behind bitcoin just to provide some context, but will mainly be focused on using bitcoin in the real world as a way to transact and store value without relying on a third party - a way for people to \"be their own bank.\" Do I have to attend the online course at a specific time? Students will be able to watch the videos that are posted on their\nown time as many times as they want, and can contact me through the\ncourse or my website for email support. Why I am the right person to teach this course and write this\nbook: I have been helping investors,\n\tbusinesses, and casual users learn about bitcoin for over two years\n\tthrough face-to-face and online education sessions. Since opening bitcoinconsultant.me to the general public in March 2013, I have\n\tpublished blog posts that have reached thousands of people, and have\n\tindividually helped dozens of people who have contacted me through\n\tthe website. On July 4, 2013, I started\n\tButtonwood SF, the first and only trading-focused cryptocurrency\n\tmeetup in San Francisco, which has over\n\t250 members and has seen\n\tnotable figures in the Bitcoin and digital currency community stop\n\tby to conduct trades and\n\tteach attendees about the technology. When I first got interested in bitcoin, it took me over six months to understand it and then buy my\n\tfirst bitcoins. I want to cut this down from months to hours or days\n\tfor students. Risks and Challenges The biggest challenge will be\ndelivering the course content and e-book on time; the due-date is\ncurrently set for January 15 th . I will overcome this\nchallenge by setting aside several hours per day starting the day the\ncrowdfunding campaign ends to write content and film instructional\nvideos. I already have a course outline and have a lot of content\nspread across multiple blog posts, presentations, and interviews I\nhave given which will be combined with the up-to-date content to\nproduce the book and the online course. Since Bitcoin is a constantly\nevolving technology, after the course and book are finished I will\ncontinue adding content as relevant information comes to light and\nnew insights are gained. Other Ways You Can Help Bitcoin donations accepted here: 1Pcnz9FdshVprHzCcy7g5dMoWj17XzwAuW If you would like to pay for the e-book, physical zine, or online course via bitcoin, please send me a private comment and I will send you an invoice.

Internet privacy involves the right or mandate of personal privacy concerning the storing, repurposing, provision to third-parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Internet privacy is a subset of computer privacy. Privacy concerns have been articulated from the beginnings of large scale computer sharing. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right that must be \nprotected at any cost. The advent of the internet has now made all of us\n more vulnerable to mass surveillance than at any other point in human \nhistory. The disappearance of online privacy is a very dangerous trend \nas in many ways privacy and freedom go hand in hand. Me, Peter, i work since 1982, so i can say i grow with computer, i did work with the simple PC until even IBM Mainframe. I learn about about the use and even about the problem\u2019s. I been focused\u00a0 on UN*X and later Linux, what else you can trust in security, speed and performance.\u00a0 Please feel free to check out my profile at Linked In to get a idea about my knowledge and the work i did until now. We want us our knowledge and idea to make the internet more secure and private as is its was years before. A free and democratic society has to have the possibilities to further develop and renew itself. Because of this, a society is in need of controversial discussions and experimenting. Every individual should be able to evolve freely in a society. The rights to freedom of expression without bringing disadvantages to herself/himself, the protection of privacy, freedom of assembly and access to media for all citizens are increasingly influencing the digital society. These rights also build the foundation for informational self-determination and data privacy. As long as there is no law or right opposed to self-determination concerning which data someone has to expose about herself/himself, we will ensure that this is possible. The main concern is to support the practical aspects of data privacy. We don't only want to have the right to informational self-determination, but we also want to actively exercise this right. We cover themes ranging from \"how to browse the Internet with leaving as less traces as possible\", \"anonymous web browsing\", \"data and email encryption\" to \"bypassing Internet censorship\". We give you the facility to browse, to exchange email and chat anonymous, safe and with a good feeling if you use the internet. We offer you a VPN, which connect you direct to one of our VPN Servers and give you access to the net and also to the \"Deep Web\" . Deep Web (also called the Deepnet, Invisible Web, or Hidden Web) is World Wide Web content that is not part of the Surface Web, which is indexed by standard search engines. We guaranty Point To Point Encryption for email, chat and voice. You can choose FreeNetMail, PGP, S/MIME, Self Destruct Message (SDM), BitMessages etc\u00a0. Please check out also our Perks which give you more information about all things you can get. You can choose 3 Levels of your privacy, very easy instant in the browser window with immediate effect. Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system. VPS hosting as a cost-efficient solution comes\n\t\t\tright in the middle of dedicated and webspace hosting product ranges \nand provides you with the advantages of both of these types.\n\t\t\tWe use a virtualization solution based on KVM and hardware that \ncorresponds to the latest state of the art. Furthermore you are provided\n with guaranteed RAM and disk space.\n\t\t\tCustomize your virtual private server to suit your needs with the pre installed operating system \"Whonix\". Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian GNU/Linux and security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP. Only connections through Tor are possible. Whonix is Free as in price and freedom, lets you run anonymous applications and servers We want also offer some special complete installed Gateways/Router/Firewall for Home/SoHo and Shop solution. Please check out also our Gallery to get more information about the parts we integrate in our system \"ICT-Secure\" I think is a open secret that only your self take care for your security and you can't trust nobody and nothing. I don't think i need to explain more about, every day you can hear about about the abusing of your privacy in various media's (tv, radio, news paper). \u00a0This is way we want install at least ten our own Server around the world to extend the \"Tor\u00a0Cloud project\", which gives you a user-friendly way of deploying bridges to help users access an uncensored Internet.\u00a0We want make \nsure\u00a0 we can trust them and prevent spying by any country\u2019s, \norganisations or even institutions. We need to install a linux\u00a0Clusters to improve performance and availability over that of a single computer, while typically being much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability and make sure all data are encrypted and secure. We have to develop a very easy User Interface, which gives the facility to install and configure all parts of the system. During the installation process all necessary programs will be installed and configured. We want make sure that there is no need for any manual maintenance and or updates/upgrades, because it's very big need\u00a0 to be always \"updated\" to make sure all security and other issues are solved and the system is up to date. Any further development will be integrated with out any action. We use only the most secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP. Furthermore, all of the cryptographic libraries we use are open source. By using open source libraries, we can guarantee that none of the encryption tools we are using have clandestinely built in back doors. We are constantly consulting security experts including IT scientists The first $80,000 will give us enough money to buy and host the servers we need to support all users currently on our waiting list. With some luck, it will be enough for us to get the UI out of beta. This will allow us to introduce paid accounts with additional storage after which the project can be self-sustaining.",

        "description": "<div>\n\n\n  <div> <h3>Why?</h3>I breed Coturnix Quails in New Zealand. Now quail prefer their space to be warm and toasty or they just go on strike and stop laying eggs. New Zealand winters are neither warm nor toasty, so we have an obvious problem.I've been running a few small crypto mining rigs for months now, and last winter my study was pretty warm through most of the winter, and this got me thinking 'hey I could do this for my quails too'.Commercial BitCoin mining is all but impossible down here because of our high electricity costs that eat into the profits and leave no dividends after normal administrative costs and salaries etc. This is where this operation differs. It has no rent, no salaries or admin expences, and no electricity costs because the mine will run exclusively on off-grid power.\n</div> <div> <h3>OK, so here's the deal:\n</h3>I need to keep my birds warm.The bird house is very well insulated, and I could just run heaters on a thermostat again (which I will do as a backup any way), but I would prefer to put that power to good use while achieving the same goal, and come one step closer to taking the farm completely off-grid in the process.The bird house roof has about 70sqm of North facing surface suitable for solar panels.There are currently 2 400W wind turbines on 6m masts that can relatively easily be upgraded to 3.5KW units.I don't need the BitCoin mined, so until all the coins ordered here are delivered I won't be keeping one single Satoshi. Each contract will be paid out on a first-come first-served basis, as the coins are mined, until everyone has been paid.Increases in difficulty will be overcome by retaining 30% of all mined coins for expansion. This will be used exclusively to buy more equipment and increase the rate at which we're able to mine coins. Not a cent will be spent on anything else.Once the last contract is paid out the panels, turbines and other equipment will remain operational on the farm providing us with free electricity for years, and the mining operation will continue to help fund our operation. All the while the quails will be warm and happy.We're trying to create an environment that is pure, organic and fully sustainable, and even though electricity is a vital part of modern life it doesn't need to be provided through dirty processes or be traded as a corporate commodity. This farm will become a haven for WOOFers and volunteers to build memories and experiences, and I feel changing our power source will be a massive step in the right direction.<h3>So where's the money going?</h3>I've decided on using Antminer S5 miners. They have a good hash/power rate, are relatively inexpensive per GH mined, produce a good sustained and fanned heat, and are the perfect size to fit in the spaces available. The miners are the least expensive part of this install though.How many miners I install depends on how much money we raise and how much power is available. Each unit consumes about 590W, so will need at least 1,500W of solar panels, supplemented with wind power, and the controllers and batteries to to manage them. All up each miner with power will cost about $2,000. Obviously unit costs decrease as the project grows.Each miner is currently able to generate about 0.35 BitCoins per month.Although we get a lot of wind, solar with batteries is still more efficient. We'll focus mainly on generating and storing solar power, and at first spend all the money raised on purchasing and installing the appropriate amount of panels to power the maximum amount of miners the money can buy.Once the roof is filled with panels, we'll bring down the existing turbines and upgrade them. Thereafter there is still lots of room for expansion. The main house has over 100sqm of North facing roof, there is space for at least 8 more turbines in moderate to high wind locations, and there are other options available.\n</div><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> This is essentially a futures contract in the highly volatile speculative Bitcoin market. What can go wrong? Well, quite honestly - just about anything.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The US government could pull the plug on the Internet, effective rendering the BlockChain useless.</li>\n<li>The Bitcoin price could inexplicably tumble and your purchase could be worthless before you even receive it.</li>\n<li>I could desert the farm and disappear without delivering your BitCoins.</li>\n<li>Lightning could strike one of the turbines burning the entire building to the ground and we lose everything.</li>\n<li>One of a multitude of other bad things could happen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess it just comes down to trust, and Indigogo's lawyers, and Paypal's refund policy, and New Zealand having some of the strictest consumer laws in the world.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day you just need to assess the risks and decide for yourself.</p>\n<p>\n</p><p>\n</p><h3>How you'll get paid</h3> <p>People change things, and our BitCoin wallets are no different. The get lost, stolen, or just change purpose over time. So to make sure we're using the right account, we'll be sending out an email to all contributors after the campaign is over, asking which BitCoin address to use for payment. That way there's less room for error. So don't worry about where to enter your account details - we'll sort that all out later.</p>\n\n<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>This is a biggie - you probably won't contribute. That's OK. Most people who read this wont, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul> </ul>Please help get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.<ul> <li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>\n<li>Share a link on Facebook</li>\n<li>Email just 2 close friends about this</li>\n<li>Print this page and put it up on a notice board\n</li> </ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p>\n</div>",

And if we can do so while helping small businesses in the historic downtown area of Omaha called the Old Market, it's a win-win for everyone. What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is way more than just a currency, it's a new layer to the internet like email. Never before have two people been able to transmit money over the internet without a bank or middleman confirming it. This new layer to the internet will effect traditional payment systems the same way email effected traditional mail. Before long, everyone will be using Bitcoin like technology for internal and external movement of money because it has 4 huge advantages. It's cheaper It's faster It's more secure It can't be abused to bail-out the \"Too Big To Fail\" There are a lot of people out there that follow Bitcoin or are curious about it, but they do so in isolation. By putting people with diverse backgrounds, but similar interests together at this one event, we will spawn learning on many different levels about money and freedom. To bring our message to the most people, we need contributions from passionate people like you. Keeping the event free to the public is very important to us, because we don't want a barrier to people getting this valuable education and community experience. What We Need & What You Get We are trying to raise $2000 to cover the cost of the venue, food, and bitcoin prizes. We have a great venue lined up, right in the heart of the Old Market. It was the best fit for a location to run all the day's activities from, and it was the most economical venue, too. If we don't reach our funding goal, it will severally limit our bitcoin prize money first and take-away much of the incentive for people to participate. Our venue costs will be funded first up to $500, and then the bitcoin prizes. If you'd like to donate bitcoin directly, you can do so here: Donate Bitcoins Perks for various levels will include: Branding in all media forms, social, banners, and programs (great for business sponsors) A personal thank you and plug for the sponsors during kickoff intro and the Networking Party Various Old Market area gift cards (great for local individuals) Our help in putting on your own similar event! Schedule 1. Three short informative talks Bitcoin Basics Bitcoin & Beyond Bitcoin Legal Review 2. Omaha Bitcoin Race Hunt for QR codes around the Old Market Multiple ways to win bitcoin prizes 3. Cocktail Hour and Networking Party Really get to know some of the people at the event Get excited by a big reveal for the Omaha area! A successful event for us will be attracting 100+ people and introducing them to Bitcoin and the community. We will get Bitcoin wallets in more hands, and there will be a small about of bitcoin in those wallets to get them started. Your contributions will directly increase the size of the Bitcoin market by attracting more users, and bringing in more people with creative ideas and diverse skills. Omaha has a thriving tech community, and getting them involved with Bitcoin can help the community as a whole! Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to make a monetary donation, there is still a way you can help! Share our campaign with friends and followers. One of the by-products of this event is that it will serve as a template for other small-to-mid sized cities to put on their own similar events. Tell your Bitcoin Meetups about our efforts and see if they can support us, too. If you are interested in having us help your efforts in your towns, contact us. Brought to you by: and",

The way this works is that you mark your interest here in good ol' fashioned fiat currency and you pay in bitcoins. This means that you will send the equivalent value in bitcoins and we will return the excess amount once its cleared that sufficient funds are in the account. We will provide detailed instructions on where to send your bitcoins and how its processed as we finalise this round.</p>\n<p>Safello started with the simple idea that the market needs a company it can trust. We are your safe fellow by:</p>\n<p>The media might have you believe so, but in reality its the exact opposite. Last year over $335m was invested into Bitcoin companies and this trend is set to continue in 2015. Adoption of Bitcoin is growing, here is the latest data from the Coindesk State of Bitcoin 2015 report:</p>\n<p>Bitcoin is a groundbreaking invention. Where the Internet changed the way we consume information, Bitcoin is changing the way we use money. And that's just the tip of the iceberg as it has the capability to not only impact the 2.2 billion banked consumers, but also the 2.5 billion unbanked people in the world today that are excluded from the global financial system. It is therefore no surprise that some of the brightest minds are very excited:</p>\n<p>(source: http://bitcoinquotations.com/)</p>\n<p>Needless to say, Bitcoin is in great company.</p>\n<p>To help educate our customers and anyone who is interested in Bitcoin and its potential impact on the global economy, we created a page with hours of video content. If you want to learn even more from an independent source we recommend visiting Bitcoin.org.</p>\n<p>Safello connects to banks and Payment Service Providers (PSPs) to make make it easy to purchase bitcoins. Today we support 32 countries through the following payment methods:</p>\n<p>On the selling side we have a 7 minute lock to guarantees the price within that time frame. </p>\n<p><strong>The mission</strong></p>\n<p>We understand that our customers want to use local payment methods. Especially in Europe there are many different preferences where a one-size-fits-all approach does not fit. Our goal is to serve customers globally with local payment methods, which is why we call this our <em>glocal approach</em>.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin represents financial freedom and Safello takes this seriously. Our wallet, currently in beta, keeps you in full control of your funds at all times. Even if Safello were to shut down your funds are save and can be restored outside of Safello. An important factor here is that the wallet remains user friendly, we spent a lot of time making it so. </p>\n<p>Features include:</p>\n<p><strong>The mission</strong></p>\n<p>To make this possible we partnered with Blockchain.info, the largest Bitcoin wallet provider in the world. We plan to expand on this philosophy by adding other external wallet and cold storage providers to the Safello platform. User choice and self-control of funds is what we strive for across the board.</p>\n<p>It is our firm belief that Bitcoin needs a killer app and we are determined to develop this together with our users. Much of the foundation that serves as a stepping stone to make this possible has been built. Meanwhile we have done our first experiments to spark usage. One of such experiments are our donations pages where we partnered up with charities to create beautifully designed campaigns, you can find them here:</p>\n<p><strong>The mission</strong>\nThe billion Dollar question on top of everyone's mind is how to get people to use Bitcoin. We believe that this takes time to do and requires tie-ins to other parts of the economy by building Value Added Services (VAS) that deliver something faster, better or cheaper than its equivalents in the traditional financial system. Since the rate of innovation is important here we plan to develop the first VAS ourselves and subsequently open up Safello's platform for others to build on.</p>\n<p>So how have we been doing? Pretty good. In fact, January 2015 was our best month ever where we traded almost 3000 bitcoins. Otherwise Safello has been on a roll too, here are our key metrics:</p>\n<p>And we're just getting started! In last week of March we will be announcing some news that could significantly improve our position in Europe. In preparation of this news we are shaping up by means of this crowd funding round. By participating in this round you will get the opportunity to join the ranks of our existing investors, some of who are the biggest names in Bitcoin like Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, Nicolas Cary, Ira Miller and Digital Currency Group.</p>\n<p>The funds we are raising are primarily used to expand our team and offering outside of Sweden to better service the European market. We want to double down on localisation of our platform with more payments methods and bank connections to establish a leading position in Europe as a stepping stone to global expansion.</p>\n<p>Safello's valuation has been steadily progressing over the last years and we follow this path with today's crowd funding round. To date we have raised ~$860k where the last valuation was set at $8.5m max cap of DCG's convertible in July 2014. Our objective is to continue this route until we can make the shares liquid through an exit or IPO.</p>\n<p>International press:</p>\n<p>Swedish press:</p>\n<p>An investment in Safello is a long term investment in the Bitcoin space. Our vision is to build the bank of the future, one that keeps the customers in control of their money and is ultimately owned by the public. The end goal is financial freedom and convenience. We have built a great fundament from which we can start delivering that value not just to Bitcoin enthusiasts, but more importantly to regular consumers around the world.</p>\n<p>Our commitment to our shareholders:</p>\n<p>We hope you will join us on our mission to change the world of finance.</p>\n<p>On behalf of the entire Safello team,</p>\n<p>Frank Schuil\nCEO &amp; Co-Founder Safello</p>",

        "description": "Our Goal With this campaign, we are asking you to help us bring Bitcoin into the mainstream by contributing to get our commercial to air on national TV during this year's Bitcoin Bowl, on ESPN, December 26. Who We Are Love Will Inc., is a self-funded software development company based in Lexington, Kentucky. Our flagship product, Pheeva , was the first Bitcoin wallet released on the App Store, and is now available for Android and Google Chrome Browser. At Love Will we want to make Bitcoin easy for everyone and designed our wallet to be \"so simple even Grandma can use it.\" We are a young group that is passionate about Bitcoin and want to share the technology with as many people as possible. Our first commercial, released this summer, has received incredible feedback from the Bitcoin community and we are now looking to share it with a wider audience. The Bitcoin Bowl is the industry's first big push into the American mainstream and presents a great opportunity for Bitcoin to leave a positive impression on a national audience. We believe that there should be quality Bitcoin specific advertising to complement the game and this moment.  Help us put Bitcoin on national TV in front of an estimated 2 million+ viewers, during this year's Bitcoin Bowl. What We Need and What You Get What we need: $45,000 by December 1, 2014 to secure an advertising spot with ESPN during the Bitcoin Bowl This will ensure that the commercial airs four times during the broadcast, as well as during any future repeat showings of the game. 100% of contributions will go directly to securing the advertising slot with ESPN. You can contribute bitcoins to the campaign by clicking the button above, and you will receive an email receipt confirming your contribution. All Bitcoin contributions will be converted into USD daily through BitPay, and contributed to the Indiegogo campaign. If we do not reach our funding goal, all Bitcoin contributions will be distributed back to the public address we received them from. If you're sending from an HD wallet, please send us an email. What you get: By contributing to this campaign you will play a key role in bringing Bitcoin to the masses on a national scale. Bitcoin has and will always be all about community participation, and this effort is no different. Let's all help bring Bitcoin into the spotlight on the national stage. Consider this Recently social tipping has exploded through outlets such as Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube, and many users see this as a great way to increase exposure to and adoption of Bitcoin. Users donate about $1, and on average, these tips are collected by only 20% of new users. These numbers indicate that the cost of one new user (who may not even purchase more bitcoin) is $5, and the effectiveness of this method is unpredictable. Bitcoin exchanges have been giving out $10 for \u201cnew\u201d user acquisition, with no specific knowledge about these users. With a national Bitcoin commercial, the community can reach just as many new, potential Bitcoiners, at a much lower cost to everyone. For example, if nine thousand members of the Bitcoin community contributed $5 each to this campaign, (the same cost to acquire one new member through social tipping), we could successfully fund the commercial and reach over TWO MILLION people. At just over 2 Cents per person, this is one of the most cost effective ways to reach new users and breaks the pattern of internet only Bitcoin advertising. Even if one 1 in 100 viewers look up Bitcoin, it is still one of the most cost effective means of reaching new eyes. The time is now, help us bring Bitcoin to the national stage. Why Us? The task of \"bringing Bitcoin into the mainstream\", is not something that we take lightly. This is a technology and an industry that we are extremely passionate about, and we believe that we have the best interests of the community in mind as we pursue this goal of bringing Bitcoin to the national stage. With that said here is a little more about us for those who are not familiar with Pheeva: In less than a year, Pheeva has grown into one of the most recognizable brands in Bitcoin. Our wallet has received high praise from new users and experts alike as one of the best, most intuitive wallets in the space. Our Coin!D system makes sending Bitcoin as easy as sending a text or an email, and through our integration with Gyft, users can seamlessly buy digital gift cards to over 200 brands, directly in their wallet.  We believe strongly in empowering true individual ownership of funds, and thus do not hold any users\u2019 private keys. In addition to ease of use, our simple interface is complimented by a robust backend to provide a world-class user experience, security, and reliability. We created the Jacket Wallet for Georgia Tech : the first custom wallet for an American university, and have partnered with BitPay and the College Cryptocurrency Network to scale this model to other universities across the country and abroad. BitPay is sponsoring the Bitcoin Bowl, and will be assisting us in promoting this campaign to the Bitcoin community and beyond. How we'll get the Word Out We will be blasting this campaign across social media outlets with the help of our friends in the Bitcoin community, but we can not bring Bitcoin into the national spotlight without your help. As a self-funded, bootstrapped startup, we understand that not everyone can make a donation, but if you support what we're trying to do please share our campaign through Reddit, Facebook and  Twitter. This is a great opportunity for the entire industry, let's help Bitcoin break into the national scene and get its first national commercial on ESPN!

        "description": "First let me thank you for taking the time to read this and being interested in Bitcoin. Here is a good introductory video about what Bitcoin is and the process of mining Bitcoin. The problem with Bitcoin is the price. It has gone up and down $50 numerous times within a 24 hour period. Now with the recent price drop several major mining farms have closed. All of them that closed shared the same problem...energy cost. So the obvious question is how can we eliminate the problem of the price of energy? Well, after some research we want to try several options. The first thing we are going to use is the revolutionary technology provided by Bloom Energy. Here is a video about Ebay using Bloom Energy to power their data center in Utah. You can also read about this on Ebay's website tech.ebay.com By signing up with Bloom Energy we will enter into a fixed price for electricity over the next 10 years. This price will be 1/3 of what the going rates are for the local price of electricity. With the money you are donating we want to play it safe and only use the most popular mining computers available. In our experience that would be the miners from Bitmaintech and Spondoolies Tech . After we are operational we want to dedicate a good percentage of our profits to keeping Bitcoin in the market. We are going to continuously buy Bitcoin in hopes of stabilizing the price. Our first mining operation will open in the Los Angeles area. If and when we are successful we want to open another mining operation in Tehachapi, California. The next level of saving on electricity costs would be to go the solar and wind route. Tehachapi, which is an hour and a half north of Los Angeles, has the most successful wind power in the entire state. Tehachapi also has very affordable land which would give us room to grow when we want to implement solar power. Again thank you for taking the time to read this. We truly believe in Bitcoin and what it can mean for the world. Your donations will pay off exponentially.",

        "description": "Our Story... By now you have probably heard about Bitcoin whether it be in the news or finance magazines, watching \" The Good Wife \" or \"Almost Human\" with your partner, or maybe you're already active in the Bitcoin Community. Point is, if your eyes have been open, you've heard about Bitcoin by now. \u00a0Hint, it's catching on, it's growing. \u00a0It's THE next big thing. Bitcoin Alchemy was started by three friends, John Drummond, Aaron Kirsch, and Perry Lucas , to help elevate Bitcoin and its services to a professional level and engage them by identifying gaps that exist today and operating our infrastructure in a professional manner. \u00a0our ultimate goal is to see this industry flourish and revolutionize banking much the same way the Internet transformed communication. \u00a020 years ago we all scoffed at Google. We said, \"What's Facebook?\" for months before it became a major part of our lives. We're not scoffing at Bitcoin. \u00a0It's here and it's revolutionizing international currency the way Amazon revolutionized online shopping. While we have big ideas, like a cryptocurrency asset tracking system and an advanced state of the art visualization and interaction system, we fully understand that we need to have a firm ground in reality with an infrastructure that can sustain us for our long term development goals. \u00a0Therefore, we are starting with what we know best; a precious metals for Bitcoin store and cryptocurrency profit switching mining pools.We're not just doing those as yet another mining pool, but integrating those services so miners have more of an incentive to stay with us. Think of us as \"your one stop click\" when it comes to Bitcoin. Nobody else has hopped in this bandwagon so we like to think we're pioneers here. One site to mine, earn, track, buy, invest... this like the bank of the your dreams except we're not giving away toasters with new accounts. \u00a0Buy hey, we'll consider adding them as perks if you give us feedback about it. As it currently stands, Bitcoin Alchemy is the first mining pool that we know of in the US to be a Limited Liability Corporation and completely transparent about its ownership and intent. \u00a0That's a big deal to us. It shows you that we're regular people, not just eggheads coding 24/7 with no idea what the average Joe is going to want or need. \u00a0We are a Silver member of the Bitcoin Foundation so that we at least have returned something to the Bitcoin community and have a vice in its direction. In addition, we intent to donate 5% of our profits to charity. More on that later. While we currently only ship bullion products to US addresses, our intent is to offer international shipping, where permitted, in the near future. Why We're Here... Right now, we need to get the word out that Bitcoin Alchemy is entering the market with our beta. \u00a0We are looking to raise $50,000 to help optimize our website and build Bitcoin Alchemy's presence in the community. Our initial marketing campaign will target community based websites such as Bitcoin Talk , Reddit ,\u00a0and several other community forums and websites. We'd like to be able to start running ad campaigns not only targeting our customers but to also become a central resource for those looking to learn more. We're not just for the veteran Bitcoin miner, we're trying to open up to noobs, to everyone that's heard of Bitcoin and wants to learn more and maybe even give it a try. Bitcoin Alchemy is a great place to begin. We know that not everyone is a cryptocurrency miner that has a room full of mining rigs and ASICs. You don't have to be that guy to benefit from Bitcoin Alchemy. We're for EVERYONE. The advertising campaign we desperately need to launch should allow us to generate sufficient interest in our mining pools that will cover our continuing operating and development costs. We know we're on to something here. We just need a little help bringing our mind blowing ideas to the next level. If our goals aren't met, what we do receive will still help us continue our development goals and organically spread the word about Bitcoin Alchemy's services. Anything counts and it all helps. Like the Internet was in the early '90s, John, Aaron, and Perry truly believe that Bitcoin is the next big disruptive technology. \u00a0$25,000 of their own money has gone into developing the platform so far and there is a lot more to do. Our Challenges... Our biggest risk is not trying at all. Many of our competitors are anonymous hobbyists that have built limited function mining pools that are not evolving to address and adhere to new regulations appearing across the globe. The advantage they have though is they have been around awhile and we are the new kid on the block. It's going to take time and effort to convince the community we are serious and trustworthy. Our Bigger Goals... $100,000 Dedicated Server and storage infrastructure to collect, store, and present all relevant public data from multiple exchanges and other sources. $150,000 Full time DBA, Frontend Web Developer, and Mobile App development team. We have lots of ideas, and we want to implement them. $250,000 One enterprise grade API interface to rule them all. Our goal is to ingest data from multiple services, and present it back in a single unified API interface. \u00a0We will also fill in the gaps that some of these services do not currently provide themselves today (historical data being a big one). $350,000 Advanced data visualizations and manipulation. Beyond upgrading and implementing our charts and graphs with a more robust (and eye candy) solution, we have some Sci-Fi ideas that we would like to explore to build a new visualization and interaction platform with. Other Ways You Can Help If you are cryptocurrency miner, please start mining with us! We promise to keep on developing and responding to community feedback to keep making ourselves better. Please tell your friends and family and spread the word!! We'd beg you but we've been told that's unbecoming.

Our technology will achieve this by an even distribution of Bitcoin relays around the globe. By multiplying the number of relays throughout the world, the transmission time of Bitcoin transactions will decrease from the present delay of minutes, to just seconds.</p><p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cash system, that differs from all state currencies as bitcoins are not produced by a central bank, but are generated by a digital process called \u2018mining\u2019, which takes place in hundreds of datacenters throughout the world, called mining farms. One bitcoin today trades at 241.2 USD, and is created as a reward for payment processing work.</p><p>All Bitcoin miners offer their computing power to verify and record payments into the public ledger. These users are rewarded with new bitcoins proportional to the amount of computing power they donate to the network.\u00a0</p><p>But the public Bitcoin network is also made up of merchants, exchangers, users and other relay nodes. These are essential members of the network who are not compensated for securing and strengthening the network.\u00a0</p><p>Your <b>IOTA</b> mediacenter is a <b>paid Bitcoin relay</b>.</p><div>\n<h3>To strengthen Bitcoin it is necessary to spread evenly around the globe a great number of transaction relays.</h3><h2>\n</h2><h2>// THE REWARD</h2>\n<h2>\n<p><b>When IOTA is ON whether you use it or not it acts as a relay and you get paid !</b></p>\n<p>How ?<b>\u00a0<b>In bitcoins.</b></b></p>\n<p>How often ?<b>\u00a0<b>Daily.</b></b></p>\n<p>How much is worth one bitcoin ?<b> today:<b>\u00a0~$242 USD.</b></b></p>\n<p>Can you trade it ?<b>\u00a0<b>yes\u00a0</b>(www.bitstamp.net).</b></p>\n<p>What could i buy with bitcoins ?<b>\u00a0<b>Whatever</b>\u00a0you want or need.<b>How much IOTA pays you ?</b></b></p>\n<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p><b><b>\n<p>The goal of the node is to be online 24/7 and thus can relay transactions in its perimeter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By default, IOTA will only use 100kbits/sec IN and OUT (10% of an average dsl line OUT) ~1Mbits/sec).</p>\n<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p><b><b>\n<p><b><b><b><b>Thus, the user letting\u00a0IOTA switched on will be rewarded as a Bitcoin miner owning around 150GH/s mining power.

Mobile currencies are very popular in Africa. Read the article about mobile money in Africa here The features mentioned above bring dozens of new business opportunities that can be used by, for example. media companies and telecom operators, as well as their partners. The need for internet-TV in Africa Due to the current analog system and the small number of TV receivers, the transition to digital broadcasting networks pose significant challenges for media companies in Africa. Internet services are used almost exclusively for mobile devices. Demand is particularly in distribution of mobile-TV content but the media companies do not have skills to execute them.\nBoth consumers and the TV-media companies are suffering from the situation. Companies need more customers to increase revenue from media income and consumers need a wider range of Internet TV services. The number of mobile users, in all continents, is growing fastest in Africa. Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Zambia have a total of 114 million mobile subscriptions and the whole of Africa has over 900 million mobile subscriptions. The number of smart-devices is growing rapidly; about 40-50% a year, being at the moment at about 20% of all mobile devices. Operatin in the African market requires a good local knowledge and networks. Neonella Ltd\u00b4s. strategic partner in Africa is Somocon Ltd. Somocon has already pre-established partner networksin the line of business. Somocon Ltd consultants are familiar with African business culture and local knowledge can be found in the very countries which Flexvee concept and format is being delivered. The entire system has been developed in cooperation with the local partners to specifically serve the needs of Africa. There is also a need for European know-how regarding the technical aspects. Neonella's advantage in Africa is it's revenue share business model, in which the cooperation can start without the customer making a significant pre-investment. Competing suppliers require a significant financial investment from their customers before the service can be started. With this simple and quick-to-implement technology it\u00b4s possible to start the project that enables a quick start of the cash flow, without either party having a need to invest capital in the costs of the initial introduction of the system. Somocon Ltd has acquired customers for Neonella, that are either in pilot- or commercial stage.The countries are: Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Zambia. There are ongoing negotiations with over 20 different partners. So far, we have developed the following: Future development: Neonella offers investors the opportunity to benefit from the increased value of the company within a few years. Market Sectors and geographical areas, to which Neonella is concentrating on, are growing rapidly. Flexvee concept is very cost effective and it provides greater increase in value on all stages of production, than other current marketting methods. Africa is a very challenging market, that Neonella Ltd. manages to great success with the local partnerships. Business Start-up in Africa on the field of Neonella Ltd., is difficult for competitors, due to the closed computer networks and expensive cross-border roaming fees in African countries Where Neonella needs funds? Neonella need financing primarily for delivery a pilot to Africa and the system management development. Neonella shall deliver several interactive internet TV systems in Africa. Since Neonella\u2019s developed system has just been completed and therefore we still need users\u2019 experiences, in general the delivering of the system in African markets has been done under a Letter of Intent. The Letter of Intent is first conditional and it becomes binding when the system is delivered and the commercial operation can begin. After the commercial operation has been launched, the income for Neonella also begins. In addition, the need for the development of the Flexveen management system is needed in order that it can be automated and easily to use, even without any IT experience or knowledge. In all, Neonella is looking for funding for the first quarter of 2015 for development 200.000 euros and for other operating expenses 100,000 euros. The essential income from Flexvee will start to roll in the first quarter of 2015. Neonella is offering to its investors a huge increase in value already in few years. (Based on the actual share\u2019s transactions, Neonella\u2019s value has increased over the last three years, from 700,000 euros to 4.8 million euros.) The markets that Neonella is aiming are predicted to have a very strong growth. A new way of marketing is needed in to provide consistently cost-effective solutions. The risks in investing in Neonella are reduced by the facts that Neonella has the business related to subcontracting in programming, the development of interactive mobile TV which is very important in African markets, as well as new forms of digital advertising that can scales globally. Nevertheless Neonella does not want to downplay the risks of a start-up type investments include without exception.
